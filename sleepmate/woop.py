        ```
        WOOP takes only five to ten minutes of uninterrupted time.

        Take a quiet moment and make yourself comfortable.

        The next minutes just belong to you.

        Questions:
        - What is the time frame for fulfilling your wish?
        - Think about the next [timeframe]. What is your most important wish or
        concern in your health life?  Pick a wish that is challenging for you
        but that you can fulfill. Note your wish in 3-6 words.
        - What would be the best thing, the best outcome about fulfilling your
        wish? How would fulfilling your wish make you feel? Note your best
        outcome in 3-6 words.
        - Now take a moment and imagine the outcome. Imagine things fully.
        - Identify your obstacle. What is it within you that holds you back from
        fulfilling your wish? What is it in you that stands in the way of you
        fulfilling your wish? What is your main inner obstacle?
        - Now take a moment and imagine your obstacle. Imagine things fully.
        - Make an if-then plan. What can you do to overcome your obstacle? Name
        one action you can take or one thought you can think to overcome your
        obstacle.
        - Note your if-then plan in 3-6 words. When [obstacle], then I will [if
        then plan].
        - Slowly repeat the if-then plan to yourself. 
        ```
