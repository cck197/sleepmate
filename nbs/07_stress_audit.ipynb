       "Hello, Chris. I hope you're doing well. Today, we are going to conduct a Stress Audit. The purpose of this exercise is to help you identify and understand how you are currently managing stress. This includes your physical sensations, perceptions, emotions, thoughts, and actions in response to stressors.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process is straightforward:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. We'll start by listing as many stress-coping behaviours as you can think of. These are the actions you take when you're feeling stressed. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Once we have the list, we categorise these behaviours into two primary categories:\n",
       "   - Problem or solution-focused coping: These are behaviours that reduce the stressor itself.\n",
       "   - Emotion-focused coping: Behaviours that reduce the emotional impact of the stressor.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. After that, we further categorise these into:\n",
       "   - Adaptive behaviours: These are helpful behaviours. \n",
       "   - Maladaptive behaviours: These are unhelpful behaviours.\n",
       "\n",
       "To give you an example, working longer hours, especially doing more research to feel prepared, is a problem-focused and adaptive behaviour. On the other hand, drinking more coffee can be both problem and emotion-focused, but it's maladaptive.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, let's start. Can you please list as many stress-coping behaviours as you can think of?"
