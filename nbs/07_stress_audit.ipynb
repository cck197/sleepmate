       "Hello, Chris! I hope you're doing well. To begin, I'd like to introduce you to an exercise called the Stress Audit. This exercise is designed to help you understand how you're currently managing stress in your life. The goal is to identify your coping behaviours and evaluate whether they are balanced and beneficial. \n",
       "\n",
       "This exercise involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. First, you need to identify and list down your behaviours when you're feeling stressed. These can be as many as you can think of - everything you do to manage your sensations, perceptions, emotions, thoughts, and actions in response to stress.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Once you have your list, you'll then categorise each behaviour into two main categories:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Problem or solution-focused coping - behaviours aimed at reducing the stressor itself.\n",
       "  \n",
       "   - Emotion-focused coping - behaviours aimed at reducing the emotional impact of the stressor.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Next, categorise these behaviours as either adaptive (helpful) or maladaptive (unhelpful).\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, working longer might be considered problem-focused and adaptive, while procrastinating might be considered emotion-focused and maladaptive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once you have your behaviours listed and categorised, we'll discuss the balance of your coping strategies. If there's an imbalance, we can brainstorm ways to balance your list. For instance, if your list leans heavily towards problem-focused coping, we might explore more emotion-focused strategies that could be helpful, like listening to calming music or practicing mindfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "So let's start. Could you please list down as many behaviours as you can that you exhibit when you're feeling stressed?"
