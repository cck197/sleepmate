      "Instead,\n",
      "I'll occasionally plug something that I admire has been valuable to me or just makes my day a bit better even though I have no affiliation with the product your company.

      "these guidelines to begin. Training\n",
      "Next there is training. Training commonly disrupts sleep by way of its timing and/or its load.\n",
      "Training timing\n",
      "If early or late training overlaps with your habitual sleep period (bearing in mind that it takes time\n",
      "to eat, get ready for training, travel to and from training, wind down from training, and so on),\n",
      "your sleep is likely to suffer. Ideally, you would adjust your schedule to avoid such overlap.\n",
      "However, if your training times can’t be changed then one option is to shift your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, respectively.\n",
      "To shift your sleep earlier, increase your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking for the\n",

      "training loads and injuries take their toll, and pain is rife in athletes. Left unchecked, poor sleep\n",
      "and pain can spiral in a vicious cycle in which poor sleep increases pain and reduces tolerance\n",
      "to painful stimuli, while in turn pain hampers sleep. Managing pain is key to maintaining healthy\n",
      "sleep in athletes, which highlights the critical importance of smart training. In addition, of the\n",

      "Next, many athletes are perfectionists and experience high levels of anxiety about performance,\n",
      "especially around competitions, which may interfere with sleep. The strategies I discussed in the\n",

      "Competition does bring unique challenges, however. First, some events take place very early or\n",

      "your patterns of light exposure can additively shift the timing of your body’s clock. If you take\n",
      "melatonin, use conventional melatonin (not the timed-release stuff) at a dose of about 1 mg (this\n",
      "is a good product). before drinking or eating anything,\n",
      "either wearing the same item of clothing or not wearing any clothes at all. For a lot of people, they might want to do this once or twice a week.\n",
      "I recognize also that this isn't for everyone. If, for example, you've got a history of eating disorders or disordered eating, then it might not be for you. But if you are simply trying to maintain a new lower body weight, then this particular habit can be transformative.\n",
      "Another habit that I think is really helpful for a lot of people that I don't believe has come up in the podcast so far is\n",
      "matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity.\n",
      "Tommy spoke about the importance of spending sufficient time in bed, that is very relevant to most people.\n",
      "And frankly, many people benefit from spending slightly more time in bed, specifically\n",
      "if they have a history of insufficient sleep. They have some sort of lifestyle driven sleep loss. For example, they wake up to the alarm clock before work days and then they try and catch up on some sleep on the weekends.\n",
      "These people would benefit from extending their time in bed, perhaps by setting their alarm clock as late as possible,\n",
      "by increasing their exposure to daylight in the morning to shift their clocks early, which will help them fall asleep earlier by reducing their caffeine intake too.\n",
      "And perhaps by reducing their exposure to strong overhead lighting in the three hours or so before bed.\n",
      "For other people, though, specifically people with insomnia type symptoms.\n",
      "They actually benefit from spending less time in bed. One of the core treatments for insomnia is called bedtime restriction therapy\n",
      "or sometimes it's called sleep restriction therapy.\n",
      "Sometimes it's called sleep consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Regardless of what you call it, the idea is to only allow yourself the amounts of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis because what happens in insomnia is that people spend lots of time awake in bed trying to sleep and unable to sleep. So for example, if you spend ten hours in bed, but you're only asleep for six of those hours,\n",
      "then you might take six hours,\n",
      "add on thirty minutes because nobody is asleep from the moment they lie down in bed, So the moment they wake up in the morning.\n",
      "And then only let yourself have six and a half hours in bed and the way that you would practice, that would be by delaying your bedtime\n",
      "but waking up at the same time that you normally wake up in the morning.\n",
      "That will reduce the amount of time that you're spending awake in bed, and substantially improve your sleep quality in short order. Although, frankly, the first week or two will be very difficult because You might find that initially your sleep quality isn't that high and you are losing a bit of sleep. You might feel very fatigued during the day,\n",
      "But very soon, the improvements in sleep quality will more than compensate for the small reduction in sleep duration that sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Then in part two of my conversation with Simon, we spoke about problem versus emotion focused coping strategies.\n",
      "And how the people who most effectively\n",
      "cope with stress tend to use both of these types of strategies.\n",

      "1. Regulation of Circadian Rhythm: Daylight plays a crucial role in synchronizing our circadian rhythm, or internal body clock. This rhythm controls sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and other bodily processes. Exposure to daylight, especially in the morning, sends signals to our brain to be awake and alert.\n",

      "5. Intensity of Light: The intensity of light in daylight is significantly higher than indoor lighting, which our non-visual system responds to. High-intensity light exposure during the day can help regulate sleep patterns and improve alertness and performance during wakefulness.\n",

      "6. Metabolic Responses: Preliminary research suggests that patterns of light exposure after meals can affect how we respond to those meals in terms of things like blood sugar levels.\n",

Here are a few key points to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sleep Disruption: As the text mentions, artificial light at night, particularly from screens, can interfere with our ability to fall asleep and maintain a high-quality sleep. This is because it suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that signals our body it's time to sleep.\n",

      "3. Social and Behavioral Consequences: The widespread use of artificial light has enabled us to work and be active at all hours, which can lead to a misalignment between our social schedules and our biological clocks. This can cause a range of issues, from sleep disorders to decreased performance and productivity.\n",
      "\n",

Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Restrict Bedtime: The therapy then involves restricting the amount of time spent in bed to match the average sleep duration. Using the previous example, the person would only spend 6 hours in bed each night. This restriction creates a mild sleep deprivation which helps to consolidate and improve sleep efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Gradual Adjustment: If sleep efficiency improves (usually to about 85% or higher), the amount of time in bed is slowly increased by about 15 minutes each week. This continues until the person finds their optimal sleep duration that results in feeling rested during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Maintain Regularity: It's important to maintain regular sleep and wake times throughout this process. This regularity helps to reinforce the body's natural circadian rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example from the text is Amy, who had insomnia and was spending 10 hours in bed but only sleeping for 6. She started bedtime restriction therapy by limiting her time in bed to 6 hours. Initially, she was more tired than usual, but her sleep efficiency improved significantly soon after. Over time, she was able to increase her time in bed while maintaining high sleep efficiency.\n",
