      "Human: when is it appropriate to use a light box?\n",
      "AI: A light box or a SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) light can be used when one lives at a high latitude where during the long winter nights, the sun is only out for a couple of hours each day. The light box should emit light at an intensity of at least two thousand lux and should contain plenty of short wavelength light. When using the light box, one should be within one meter of it and it should be used for at least thirty minutes each day, possibly up to sixty minutes as needed. The use of the light box can be timed appropriately if one is trying to shift their clock earlier or later. For instance, it can be used in the morning if one is trying to shift their sleep schedule earlier or in the evening if they are trying to shift it later. For those with seasonal affective disorder, it is generally recommended to use the light box within a couple of hours of waking in the morning.\n",

      "AI: Hello, Chris! How are you feeling today? Would you be open to discussing a daily routine that might help improve your sleep?\n",
      "Human: sure\n",
      "AI: The daily routine suggested in the text seems to be a balanced mix of physical activity, adequate rest, healthy eating, and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Adequate Rest: The routine emphasizes the importance of taking rest days in between strenuous physical activities. For example, following the \"biblical training week\" concept, one should have a day of rest within the week.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Physical Activity: Exercise is encouraged, particularly in the late afternoon around 5 or 6 PM. This coincides with the end of the working day and is when the body is said to be primed for strenuous exercise. It's also suggested to engage in frequent low-intensity activity throughout the day to support overall health and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Healthy Eating: The routine suggests following a time-restricted eating pattern, where you consume calories within a 12-hour window or less each day. Ideally, this window should end at least two hours before bed. The focus of nutrition should be on foods that have a high satiety per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, fungi like mushrooms, lean meats, and fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consistent Sleep Schedule: The routine highlights the importance of matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity. If you have a history of insufficient sleep, it's recommended to extend your time in bed, perhaps by setting the alarm clock as late as possible, reducing caffeine intake, and minimizing exposure to bright overhead lighting before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Stress Management: The routine emphasizes the use of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies to deal with stress. An example given is \"scheduled worry time\" where you dedicate a specific period in the day to worry, thus compartmentalizing it from the rest of your day.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Exposure to Natural Light: The routine advises spending at least an hour outdoors in daylight each day and minimizing exposure to bright overhead lights in the hours before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Avoidance of Snacking: The routine suggests that avoiding snacks can be beneficial for many people, as most snacking is mindless, and we often choose low-quality foods when we snack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, this is just a suggested routine and might not work for everyone. Always consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your daily routine.\n",

      "And this clock doesn't tick a precisely twenty four hours and therefore it must be reset each day. The way that we do this is by giving the clock well timed high amplitude\n",
      "time queues each date. And there are several of these that matter.\n",
      "Arguably the one that matters the most is the light dark cycle,\n",
      "and you can give your body's clock,\n",
      "specifically\n",
      "the central clock in your brain that influences things like the timing of your sleep wake cycle,\n",
      "strong time cues by spending at least an hour outdoors in daylight each day\n",
      "by minimizing your exposure\n",
      "to bright overhead lights in the three hours of four bed and by sleeping in near or total darkness. And if you've got light coming in from outdoors, you can accomplish that by wearing an eye mask.\n",
      "When you're physically active also matters and your body is primed for very strenuous\n",
      "exercise\n",
      "in the late biological afternoon, which a lot of people is around five or six PM coinciding with roughly the end of the working date. So that's often ideal for many of us, although gyms do tend to be very busy at that time of date. But otherwise,\n",
      "I hope that you do aim to move frequently throughout the day because brief bouts at even low intensity activity\n",
      "can support many aspects of your health and function.\n",
      "Including your blood sugar control and your brain function.\n",
      "And then I spoke about eating fasting cycles\n",
      "which are particularly important to setting the timing of some of the clocks outside of the central clock in your body's clock system,\n",
      "so called peripheral clocks.\n",
      "Nowadays, there's lots of talk about time restricted eating,\n",
      "which to me is kind of finding your intake of anything that contains calories to a period of twelve hours or less each twenty four hour day. And for most people, an eating window, the time elapsed from the first to the final calorie of the day. Of eight to ten hours works really well.\n",
      "And ideally, that window should end at least two hours before bed. If you can stick to that, you'll probably eat a bit less and improve many aspects of your health as well.\n",
      "The final episode that I did with a guest was with doctor Stephen Giernate,\n",
      "And that conversation focused on obesity and how you can lose fat\n",
      "quickly\n",
      "and safely\n",
      "and keep it off.\n",
      "Steffen emphasized the importance of several things. One of these was focusing\n",
      "your nutrition on foods that have a high satiety\n",
      "per calorie.\n",
      "These include foods such as fruits,\n",
      "vegetables,\n",
      "fungi such as mushrooms,\n",

      "fish as well.\n",
      "Based on that, if you're trying to lose fat, it makes a lot of sense to\n",
      "have those constitute the bulk of your nutrition each day.\n",
      "Stefan spoke about how increased snacking has correlated strongly with the rise and prevalence of obesity.\n",
      "The reality is that most nagging is mindless, and we tend choose relatively low quality foods when we snack as well. And so simply excluding snacks can work very well for many people. before drinking or eating anything,\n",
      "either wearing the same item of clothing or not wearing any clothes at all. For a lot of people, they might want to do this once or twice a week.\n",
      "I recognize also that this isn't for everyone. If, for example, you've got a history of eating disorders or disordered eating, then it might not be for you. But if you are simply trying to maintain a new lower body weight, then this particular habit can be transformative.\n",
      "Another habit that I think is really helpful for a lot of people that I don't believe has come up in the podcast so far is\n",
      "matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity.\n",
      "Tommy spoke about the importance of spending sufficient time in bed, that is very relevant to most people.\n",
      "And frankly, many people benefit from spending slightly more time in bed, specifically\n",
      "if they have a history of insufficient sleep. They have some sort of lifestyle driven sleep loss. For example, they wake up to the alarm clock before work days and then they try and catch up on some sleep on the weekends.\n",
      "These people would benefit from extending their time in bed, perhaps by setting their alarm clock as late as possible,\n",
      "by increasing their exposure to daylight in the morning to shift their clocks early, which will help them fall asleep earlier by reducing their caffeine intake too.\n",
      "And perhaps by reducing their exposure to strong overhead lighting in the three hours or so before bed.\n",
      "For other people, though, specifically people with insomnia type symptoms.\n",
      "They actually benefit from spending less time in bed. One of the core treatments for insomnia is called bedtime restriction therapy\n",
      "or sometimes it's called sleep restriction therapy.\n",
      "Sometimes it's called sleep consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Regardless of what you call it, the idea is to only allow yourself the amounts of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis because what happens in insomnia is that people spend lots of time awake in bed trying to sleep and unable to sleep. So for example, if you spend ten hours in bed, but you're only asleep for six of those hours,\n",
      "then you might take six hours,\n",
      "add on thirty minutes because nobody is asleep from the moment they lie down in bed, So the moment they wake up in the morning.\n",
      "And then only let yourself have six and a half hours in bed and the way that you would practice, that would be by delaying your bedtime\n",
      "but waking up at the same time that you normally wake up in the morning.\n",
      "That will reduce the amount of time that you're spending awake in bed, and substantially improve your sleep quality in short order. Although, frankly, the first week or two will be very difficult because You might find that initially your sleep quality isn't that high and you are losing a bit of sleep. You might feel very fatigued during the day,\n",
      "But very soon, the improvements in sleep quality will more than compensate for the small reduction in sleep duration that sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Then in part two of my conversation with Simon, we spoke about problem versus emotion focused coping strategies.\n",
      "And how the people who most effectively\n",
      "cope with stress tend to use both of these types of strategies.\n",
      "Problem focused\n",
      "strategies\n",
      "address the underlying cause\n",
      "of stress.\n",
      "For some people, that might be financial stress due to spending too much money on non essential things.\n",
      "For others, the stress might be from a toxic relationship.\n",
      "A helpful example of a problem focused coping strategy\n",
      "is called scheduled\n",
      "worry time.\n",
      "The idea here is that we're trying to compartmentalize\n",
      "the time that we spend wiring each day by dedicating\n",
      "a specific period\n",
      "in which to worry.\n",
      "And sometimes you might dedicate a specific space\n",
      "in which to worry you could have a worry chair in your office or in your home where you practice\n",
      "your worry time.\n",
      "And during this worry time, sit down with a piece of paper and a pen. You can also use a laptop or your phone for this, we\n",
      "sit on the sofa\n",
      "in the evening with something that's convenient\n",
      "and tasty and energy dense.\n",
      "And we watch TV at the same time. And then twenty minutes later, all of a sudden,\n",
      "the pack of crisps is gone. Or the box of biscuits is no longer there. And we barely remember having consumed those items,\n",
      "and it happens to all of us.\n",
      "Moving on to a mean function, being physically active and eating\n",
      "both increase exposure to pathogens,\n",
      "And so it makes sense that we have time of day fluctuations in immune function to anticipate these exposures.\n",
      "A really vivid example\n",
      "of the importance of this is that some rodents are actually more likely to die following pathogen exposure\n",
      "during the biological night than during the biological date.\n",
      "Regarding the clocks in your skin,\n",
      "these effects when you're most susceptible to damage from UV radiation,\n",
      "I find it fascinating that these clocks in your skin can be shifted\n",
      "by food intake, and that might have some bearing on when you're most sensitive to UV induced skin damage,\n",
      "at least if humans are anything like rodents\n",
      "and people who are more interested in that subject can look at some work that was published on this a few years ago by Joseph Takahashi and some of his colleagues.\n",
      "Skinclocks might also have some influence on wound healing.\n",
      "John O'neil did some research\n",
      "showing that wounds heal faster during the day\n",
      "due to clocks affecting the trafficking of cells to sites of damage and subsequent adhesion of those cells.\n",
      "So on the off chance you get a cut, I hope for your sake that it's during the daytime because that might help you heal faster from it.\n",
      "I now want to also discuss the subject of chronic pharmacology,\n",
      "and that is the study of the interplay between biological clocks. And drugs, medications.\n",
      "It might be the better understanding your clockwork\n",
      "and the best time to biological day at which to take drugs\n",
      "can improve your responses to those drugs and lower side effects and costs.\n",
      "A helpful way of actualizing chronopharmacology\n",
      "is as follows. We can use drugs to target clocks and thereby improve their function.\n",
      "Which might then influence things like responses\n",
      "to other interventions.\n",
      "An example of this would be using melatonin to improve clock function.\n",
      "There are some small molecules that have been identified that might have some effects on clock function too, such as nebitin, whether that's true in humans, I think time will tell.\n",
      "Another way that we can use chronic pharmacology is to recognize that if clocks affect treatment responses,\n",
      "then if we can understand those clocks,\n",
      "we can better time drug use.\n",
      "For example,\n",
      "circadian clocks in many different tissues,\n",
      "and\n",
      "those include the liver\n",
      "will influence the absorption, the distribution,\n",
      "the metabolism,\n",
      "and the excretion\n",
      "of various different drugs.\n",
      "This is also relevant to the fact that many drugs\n",
      "target\n",
      "particular\n",
      "pathways that our clock regulated.\n",
      "So let's give you some examples of the relevance of this. Going back to targets for cycle strongly each day, HMG co a reductase\n",
      "is the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.\n",
      "And the target of many cholesterol\n",
      "lowering drugs,\n",
      "such as\n",
      "statins.\n",
      "And we know that people who use cymbristat in one of these statins in the evening\n",
      "get better responses\n",
      "in terms of their cholesterol\n",
      "than people who use it in the morning.\n",
      "Another example of this is if people's symptoms vary substantially over the course of the day, drugs that target those symptoms should probably be taken at specific times if they take the instance of arthritic joint pain and stiffness, which tends to be much worse\n",
      "around the time we wake up each morning.\n",
      "We can also think about drugs that disrupt physiology\n",
      "that strongly cycles.\n",
      "If\n",
      "you take some sort of stimulant medication,\n",
      "let's say that you're taking ritalin for ADHD,\n",
      "You wouldn't wanna take that late in the day because that will disrupt your sleep wake cycle, which has this strong rhythm. but during aging in some forms of pathology, so for example, Alzheimer's disease,\n",
      "This time scale invariance actually starts to break down, which potentially\n",
      "serves as a biomarker or a dysfunction.\n",
      "We'll return to today's subject in just a moment, but before we do, I'm going to be cheeky and ask a small favor.\n",
      "The most popular health podcasts have huge budgets\n",
      "and entire marketing teams behind them.\n",
      "Truth be told I'm the only person that works on this podcast.\n",
      "I do all the prep, the recording,\n",
      "the editing,\n",
      "the social media, which I do remarkably badly, I admit\n",

      "Since we're focusing on circadian rhythms, I want to point out that they're not just all twenty four hour fluctuations\n",
      "in your biology.\n",
      "And they actually have some cool characteristics\n",
      "that distinguish them from some other twenty four hour changes in your biology.\n",
      "One of these is that their autonomous are self generated\n",
      "and what this means is that they persist when there aren't any time cues in the environment.\n",
      "This was actually first documented\n",
      "in plants\n",
      "in seventeen twenty nine.\n",
      "Very talented French man named Jean jacques Dortu de Mairan,\n",
      "put a mimosa\n",

      "that continue to occur\n",
      "in the absence\n",
      "of light in the environment, and that suggests that the movements were the product of,\n",
      "changes in the light environment,\n",
      "but were instead generated by some internal\n",
      "timekeeping system.\n",
      "Some of the early work showing this in humans was done in caves and bunkers\n",

      "rhythms\n",
      "or endogenous rhythms.\n",
      "This brings up the subject of what's called masking.\n",

      "rhythmic changes in biology\n",
      "but without affecting\n",
      "the actual biological clock itself.\n",
      "So if you think about your core body temperature, for example,\n",

      "when somebody is just resting\n",
      "in Constance and darkness\n",
      "However,\n",
      "you can also do things that will acutely change your core body temperature.\n",
      "If you go and do a bunch of strenuous physical activity, your core body temperature arrives,\n",
      "or if you have a large meal, particularly if it's very high in protein, it will rise as well. And so identify biological rhythms, we actually need to use very precise methods.\n",
      "And I won't go into these, but they include things like constant routine protocols,\n",
      "and we can also use force the Synchrony ones.\n",
      "Another property of\n",
      "these biological rhythms is that they're intrainable.\n",
      "As I mentioned, they're not precisely twenty four hours, and so they need to be reset each day.\n",
      "They're reset by these time queues And the word that's often used for these is zeigabbers, German word that just means time givers, roughly.\n",
      "The strongest time key for your body's clock is\n",
      "the light dark cycle, and\n",
      "it responds to light according to the spectrum of the light the intensity of the light and the timing of the light too.\n",

      "and to show you how you can act on this information\n",
      "to live a better life.\n",
      "Will cover a lot of ground\n",
      "and the details of each subject that I touch on could easily fill several books\n",
      "let alone a few podcasts,\n",

      "whereas if you're trying to shift your clock later,\n",
      "and this is often true of older adults. In humans,\n",
      "the most conspicuous of these and probably the only one of these that we're actually aware of is the menstrual cycle, which last about twenty eight days, but\n",
      "for some people, it's as short as twenty one. For others, it can be up to about thirty five.\n",
      "But some other animals have multiple different infraadium rhythms,\n",
      "and\n",
      "they come in different classes in brady rhythms,\n",
      "rhythms that last substantially\n",
      "longer than twenty four hours, and one class of these rhythms is what's called as a cannual rhythm. Rhythmic changes\n",
      "in an organism's biology that occur roughly every three hundred and sixty five days.\n",
      "And examples of these would be fear shedding antlers at a similar time each year.\n",
      "Another of these would be used breeding in autumn each year. And interestingly, many of these are annual changes in the biology of other organisms\n",
      "are actually driven by changes\n",
      "in day length and night length,\n",
      "and hence the biological night time. So it's the change in melatonin synthesis\n",
      "duration\n",
      "that is\n",
      "influencing\n",
      "some of these changes such as in reproductive function.\n",
      "And then the shortest rhythms that we have are what are called Altradian rhythms.\n",
      "These are\n",
      "rhythms that occur multiple times\n",
      "every twenty four hour day. And the review of these, but one of the best known is the stage of different sleep that we cycle through\n",
      "during each bout of overnight sleep.\n",
      "You've probably heard people say that the sleep cycles last ninety minutes.\n",
      "They actually vary quite a lot. And early in the sleep period, they tend to be a bit shorter than that, maybe seventy minutes,\n",
      "but then late in the sleep they can be substantially longer. They can be up to about a hundred and twenty minutes.\n",
      "It's important to recognize too that they're not a very neat\n",
      "because many of us wake up frequently during the ninth. So\n",
      "it's not like they're perfectly\n",
      "orderly ninety minute cycles that take place like clockwork and If you do wake up occasionally during the night, I really don't want you to be too concerned about that.\n",
      "Another of these old trading rhythms is your heart rate and there are a few more, but I think those will do us for now.\n",
      "Related to this, we can think of these different rhythms across various timescales as being harmonics of each other, which might sound slightly a page.\n",
      "But what I mean by that is that Longer rhythms are actually comprised of shorter rhythms that are superimposed on each other. For example,\n",
      "twenty four hour rhythms\n",
      "can actually be broken down into twelve algorithms,\n",
      "and then twelve algorithms can be broken down into six algorithms.\n",
      "And so out rhythms can be broken down into two algorithms\n",
      "and so on. This type of relationship is\n",
      "seen in some biological rhythms. So for example,\n",
      "it is evident\n",
      "in\n",
      "your patterns of growth hormone production each day\n",
      "in that there is a circadian rhythm in growth hormones with peak production of this hormone during the biological night time\n",
      "But within that rhythm, there are also pulsatile changes in growth hormone that occur on these all trading time scales.\n",
      "And then related to these nested rhythms,\n",
      "there's another concept called time scale invariance\n",
      "that's really discussed and not that well studied, but very interesting.\n",
      "The idea here is that some rhythms have the same properties across different time scales.\n",
      "Which is a bit like the kinds of tractal patterns that you might have seen when scouring the internet, but also that a evident in nature.\n",
      "And when you look at these fractal patterns, they look very similar whether you're zoomed in close to them or zoomed out away from them. And so an example of this would be looking at the branching of trees. And\n",
      "in resilient organisms,\n",
      "organisms\n",
      "that have good health, you tend to see clear time scale invariance\n",
      "in rhythms across various different time scales ranging from minutes to twenty four hours,\n",
      "but during aging in some forms of pathology, so for example, Alzheimer's disease,\n",
      "This time scale invariance actually starts to break down, which potentially Amy seemingly always feels sleepy during the day. She is generally meticulous about practising\n",
      "good sleep hygiene, but she just can’t stop waking up for extended periods at night.\n",
      "She begins tracking her sleep. She learns that, on average, she’s in bed from 10 PM to 8 AM\n",
      "each night - a 10-hour sleep opportunity. But she’s only asleep for 6 of those hours in total, so\n",
      "her sleep efficiency is 60 % (6 / 10 X 100).\n",

      "I'm half joking when I say that, but the rise in the popularity\n",
      "of bubbles and branches in recent years probably actually been good for people overall.\n",
      "Anyway,\n",
      "less is better.\n",
      "And I described some recommendations in terms of units. It's probably worth me spelling out water unit is. One unit is the amount of alcohol that's in ten milliliters\n",
      "or eight grams of pure ethanol.\n",
      "And if you wanna get an idea of the unit quantities of common drinks, then there are resources\n",
      "such as the unit calculator\n",
      "at drink aware dot co dot u k and alcohol change dot org dot u k that you can go to for more information. The final subject that I want to turn to is disruption\n",

      "Many diseases and disease processes are characterized by biological clock and circadian rhythm abnormalities.\n",
      "We see this in some metabolic diseases. People do have abnormal melatonin rhythms.\n",

      "melatonin rhythm abnormalities and insufficient melatonin product seen to forecast diseases such as diabetes.\n",
      "There are also clear time of day variations and symptoms in any diseases too, what spoke earlier about arthritis, but a taxing example of this is so called sundowning\n",
      "in some neurodegenerative with no more than four on a given day,\n",
      "and this might sound a little bit difficult to pass, but I recommend allowing at least one hour before bed\n",
      "per unit consumed\n",
      "plus one hour. So to give you an example,\n",
      "a pint of beer is typically about two units\n",
      "So two units would be two hours, but then plus one hour, that would be finishing\n",
      "applying to beer,\n",
      "at least\n",
      "three hours before bed. If it was two pints of beer, that would be four units\n",
      "plus one hour. So that'd be finishing your two pints of beer at least five hours before bed.\n",
      "And that's to do with the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol.\n",
      "And then that brings us to fluid in general.\n",
      "There's not much evidence that things like water intake will affect the circadian clock, your biological clocks, but\n",
      "nevertheless,\n",
      "I think it is relevant to sleep, and you should modify\n",

      "And in general, I think coinciding your final rinc of the day with your final calories of the day is a good starting point, but you might even want to cap your intake earlier than that.\n",

      "there are best times of there which to take certain medications.\n",
      "For example, it seems to be best to take ACE inhibitors, which commonly used to reduce blood pressure\n",

      "each day, preferably in the first half of your waking day. Why not take an early lunch\n",
      "break outdoors with others?\n",
      "● Limit your consumption of stimulants such as caffeine: Cap your intake at 2 mg caffeine\n",

      "period.\n",

      "(very!) large differences between people in how their sleep is affected by these stimuli, but try\n",
      "these guidelines to begin. Training\n",
      "Next there is training. Training commonly disrupts sleep by way of its timing and/or its load.\n",
      "Training timing\n",
      "If early or late training overlaps with your habitual sleep period (bearing in mind that it takes time\n",
      "to eat, get ready for training, travel to and from training, wind down from training, and so on),\n",
      "your sleep is likely to suffer. Ideally, you would adjust your schedule to avoid such overlap.\n",
      "However, if your training times can’t be changed then one option is to shift your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, respectively.\n",
      "To shift your sleep earlier, increase your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking for the\n",

      "I recognize also that this isn't for everyone. If, for example, you've got a history of eating disorders or disordered eating, then it might not be for you. But if you are simply trying to maintain a new lower body weight, then this particular habit can be transformative.\n",
      "Another habit that I think is really helpful for a lot of people that I don't believe has come up in the podcast so far is\n",
      "matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity.\n",
      "Tommy spoke about the importance of spending sufficient time in bed, that is very relevant to most people.\n",
      "And frankly, many people benefit from spending slightly more time in bed, specifically\n",
      "if they have a history of insufficient sleep. They have some sort of lifestyle driven sleep loss. For example, they wake up to the alarm clock before work days and then they try and catch up on some sleep on the weekends.\n",
      "These people would benefit from extending their time in bed, perhaps by setting their alarm clock as late as possible,\n",
      "by increasing their exposure to daylight in the morning to shift their clocks early, which will help them fall asleep earlier by reducing their caffeine intake too.\n",
      "And perhaps by reducing their exposure to strong overhead lighting in the three hours or so before bed.\n",
      "For other people, though, specifically people with insomnia type symptoms.\n",
      "They actually benefit from spending less time in bed. One of the core treatments for insomnia is called bedtime restriction therapy\n",
      "or sometimes it's called sleep restriction therapy.\n",
      "Sometimes it's called sleep consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Regardless of what you call it, the idea is to only allow yourself the amounts of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis because what happens in insomnia is that people spend lots of time awake in bed trying to sleep and unable to sleep. So for example, if you spend ten hours in bed, but you're only asleep for six of those hours,\n",
      "then you might take six hours,\n",
      "add on thirty minutes because nobody is asleep from the moment they lie down in bed, So the moment they wake up in the morning.\n",
      "And then only let yourself have six and a half hours in bed and the way that you would practice, that would be by delaying your bedtime\n",
      "but waking up at the same time that you normally wake up in the morning.\n",
      "That will reduce the amount of time that you're spending awake in bed, and substantially improve your sleep quality in short order. Although, frankly, the first week or two will be very difficult because You might find that initially your sleep quality isn't that high and you are losing a bit of sleep. You might feel very fatigued during the day,\n",
      "But very soon, the improvements in sleep quality will more than compensate for the small reduction in sleep duration that sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Then in part two of my conversation with Simon, we spoke about problem versus emotion focused coping strategies.\n",

      "1. Regulation of Circadian Rhythm: Daylight plays a crucial role in synchronizing our circadian rhythm, or internal body clock. This rhythm controls sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and other bodily processes. Exposure to daylight, especially in the morning, sends signals to our brain to be awake and alert.\n",

      "3. Vitamin D Production: Exposure to daylight, specifically UVB rays from the sun, is essential for our bodies to produce vitamin D, which is vital for bone health, immune function, and other biological processes.\n",

      "4. Mood and Cognitive Function: Daylight exposure can positively affect our mood and cognition. It can help prevent mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and improve cognitive performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Intensity of Light: The intensity of light in daylight is significantly higher than indoor lighting, which our non-visual system responds to. High-intensity light exposure during the day can help regulate sleep patterns and improve alertness and performance during wakefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Metabolic Responses: Preliminary research suggests that patterns of light exposure after meals can affect how we respond to those meals in terms of things like blood sugar levels.\n",

      "exposure.\n",
      "If you spend plenty of time outdoors\n",

      "filter out short wavelength light from these screens using two things like night shift mode. If you have an iPhone, night mode, if you have an Android phone, there's a software program named f dot luck that I use on my laptop that you can use too, and it just gives the screen an amber hue when the sun is down in your location.\n",

The problem is that looking at the research, a lot of people don't really like them, and they end up just disabling them after a short period of time. But If you don't mind them and I don't mind them, then there's no harm in using them whatsoever. And then finally on the subject of light, I just wanna mention some of these other non visual of light that I've alluded to, and I do want to address this subject in a lot more detail later. So we'll have a subsequent episode on how light affects other aspects of health, but just to give you some information\n",
      "about some of the other affects a light exposure on your biology. Many of these are positive. Getting plenty of daylight seems to help prevent myopia, so it's important your ability to see clearly and not end up being very short sighted as I used to be before Harigale's eye surgery.\n",
      "Another is affecting your cognition. There's fascinating work, for instance, showing that you can change office lighting to affect\n",
      "workers' performance\n",
      "Another is your mood, and if you've ever had seasonal effect disorder, then you'll know first hand how much light exposure can affect your mood. Another is your hormones,\n",
      "especially your sex hormones.\n",
      "One of the reasons why many of us feel a bit friskier in the summer seems to relate to the fact that we high levels of certain sex steroids at this time of year in response to greater UV radiation from the sun. Another is\n",
      "your metabolism.\n",
      "There's some preliminary research showing the patterns of light exposure we get after meals will affect how you respond to those meals in terms of things like blood sugar. And then another is\n",
      "your blood pressure.\n",
      "It seems that getting plenty of daylight might help push down your blood pressure by acting nitric oxide signaling\n",
      "in your vascular system. And then finally, your exposure to daylight will affect your vitamin d state which is the subject that tends to get the most headlines,\n",
      "and your vitamin d status is important to things like your bone health, but also your immune function too.\n",
      "The corollary of this though is that there are negative effects of excessive exposure\n",
      "to sunlight.\n",
      "One of those is, of course,\n",
      "sun induced skin damage, and and they put them through this type of circadian misalignment protocol. And they found that they still experienced worsening\n",
      "of their blood sugar control and their insulin action too. And so people don't seem to learn to accommodate this type of disruption over time.\n",
      "And then finally, thinking about clock disruption in the context of society at large. Let's turn our attention to the social clock. Starting with shift work, we know that shift work is associated with increased risk of various diseases, particularly night shift work. It tends to increase risk of certain cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke, type two diabetes,\n",
      "and maybe asthma too, going by some recent work, Some of this relates to clock disruption. Some of it also probably relates to sleep in general.\n",
      "And about quarter of shift work is experiencing they called shift work disorder, the circadian rhythm sleep weight disorder in which people\n",
      "struggle to sleep when they try because they're often\n",
      "sleeping\n",
      "at a time of day, which their biological clock is promoting ratefulness. And then when they have to be awake, they're really sleepy because sometimes the wage period overlaps with the biological nighttime, but also because since they haven't been sleeping very well, they have a residue\n",
      "of insufficient\n",
      "sleep, causing sleepiness\n",
      "that's then compromising their daytime functioning. That exemplifies how not just clock disruption that increases risk of some maladies and shift workers. And if you think about night shift work, it also entails increased exposure to artificial light at night. Increased calorie consumption\n",
      "during the biological nighttime increased stimulant use during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "more physical activity during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "strain social relationships,\n",
      "various other stresses that could contribute to health problems beyond disruptions, the clock itself.\n",
      "So regarding artificial light and night,\n",
      "this has increased in its pervasiveness\n",
      "and intensity\n",
      "in recent years. Going by satellite data. And we know that's associated\n",
      "with biased speech based on both cross sectional studies in which people look at the intense of light pollution in different areas and then ask people to self report their sleep, but also based on rigorous experiments.\n",
      "And A simple antidote to this night is to wear an eye mask. There was a nice experiment done recently showing they're doing, so it might not only improves sleep, but possibly benefit some aspects of cognitive function too. There might be some less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night as well. One of these is an increased propensity\n",
      "to develop the obesity. There have been associations team artificial itemized in obesity and dozens of countries around the world,\n",
      "but one of the better studies potential consequences of artificial light at night is an increase in risk of some forms of cancer and breast cancer specifically.\n",
      "Going by large scale epidemiological\n",
      "studies,\n",
      "in which people are again just looking at big groups of people where artificial light and night is taking place, and then who's getting cancer, It's hard to tell whether there is a signal there and whether that relationship does in fact exist.\n",
      "There are a few reasons to suspect that there might be some small effects.\n",
      "One is due to melatonin disruption.\n",
      "Melatonin seems to have some mild anti cancer properties\n",
      "those probably relate to both its effects on metabolic control,\n",
      "sleep, and immune function too. But light at night can probably disrupt hormones in other ways as well. And so I think we really need more research on that subject, but certainly, there are reason to suspect that there might be a real relationship there.\n",
      "Another form of societal clock disruption relates to people's chronotypes, whether they're morning likes or night outs. Spoke a bit about this in the previous episode, but sleep wake timing changes over the course of one's life span such that you probably will have experienced your late\n",
      "sleep wake timing there's actually a newly developed\n",
      "international standard compliant way of quantifying\n",
      "the of the light that we're exposed to on these specialized cells.\n",
      "And that metric is named the melanopic equivalent daytime illuminance, which I mentioned on the episode\n",
      "with James Hewitt. And basically, since it's these Snellanops and containing cells\n",
      "that are key, we need a measurement\n",
      "that accounts for that. And the melanopic,\n",
      "equivalent daytime illuminance, isn't the same as the photoopic,\n",
      "equivalent daytime illuminance,\n",
      "which is what most people refer to lack which is a unit of light intensity.\n",
      "One lacks is the intensity of light that's emitted by one candle held one meter from the eye. Electric lighting,\n",
      "which is very good for letting us see,\n",
      "tends to stimulate these melanopsin containing cells less at a given level of illuminance than daylight does. That's one of the reasons why it's so important to spend plenty of time outdoors each day.\n",
      "Besides the wavelength of light though, it's spectral composition.\n",
      "The intensity matters too,\n",
      "and going back to luck\n",
      "The intensity of light in a well lit office\n",
      "might be around five hundred blocks. But even in the UK,\n",
      "On a sunny day\n",
      "around midday,\n",
      "the intensity light can get up to about a hundred thousand blocks. Two hundred times brighter\n",
      "than that well lit office.\n",
      "And while your visual system doesn't respond strongly to that difference, your non visual system does,\n",
      "and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that you spend at least an hour outdoors\n",
      "in daylight each day.\n",
      "So returning to those recommendations regarding light exposure that I gave at the start, I'll plug a few gaps now.\n",
      "At this point, I want to preemptively\n",
      "field a few questions that some of you might have. One of those is how do I get more daylight?\n",
      "And a few simple ways would be eat outdoors when you can. The moment here in the UK is the summer. So that is a real option, although the weather recently has frankly been pretty rubbish.\n",
      "Another is to go for short walks after meals, and you're not only gonna benefit from the light exposure then, but also things like the fact that you're being physically and that's going to improve your metabolic responses to those meals. And then another would be just park further from some of your destinations.\n",
      "So if you drive into work, for instance,\n",
      "maybe you park a little bit further from your workplace. Another question you might have is, what do I do if I live at a high latitude and during the long nights of winter, the sun is only out and for a couple of hours each day. It's a pretty good question. And in this instance, I would recommend perch seeing a SAD light or light box, and definitely get one that emits\n",
      "light and intensity of at least two thousand lux\n",
      "and it should contain plenty of short wavelength light. And frankly, most of these types of devices do. I have no affiliation with them, but here in the UK, for instance, there's a company named Lumi that makes good products.\n",
      "If you get one of these, then you want to be within one meter of it when you use it. And I wouldn't have it directly in front of myself, but instead just off at a slight angle.\n",
      "You use it for at least thirty minutes each day, but maybe sixty minutes\n",
      "timed as needed. So returning to what I was saying at the start, you might be trying to shift your clock earlier or later. In which case, you can I'm your use of this appropriately. So you're using it in the morning if you're trying to shift early or or in the evening if you're trying to shift later. And if you have seasonal effecting disorder, I would pretty much just follow the same advice that I just gave if you wanna try one of these devices, except for the the best time for seasonal effects order to use these is generally within a couple of hours away in the morning.\n",
      "Another question you might have is what types of light bulbs are best for my home?\n",
      "At night, certainly,\n",
      "you want to use incandescent\n",
      "or warm white bulbs.\n",
      "The lighting should ideally be\n",
      "indirect And he filed a couple of patents,\n",
      "went on to improve existing electric lights And then in eighteen eighty, the Edison Electric Light Company\n",
      "began making their first commercial electric light bulbs at scale.\n",
      "And as we'll get to you, this not only distracted people's biological clocks, it also enabled waiting behaviors.\n",
      "Such as eating\n",
      "at times of day when people's clocks were in fact promoting,\n",
      "resting, and sleep.\n",
      "And maybe most significantly, the emergence of these electric lights enable people to work round the clock. And so, our twenty fourseven shift working society was born.\n",
      "So nowadays,\n",
      "a third clock influences our lives more and more, and that is the social or society o'clock, which has enormous\n",
      "consequences for how we feel and function each day.\n",
      "We'll return turn to that social clock in a later episode.\n",
      "But for now, I just wanna zoom in on our biological clock.\n",
      "And why we have these in the first place.\n",
      "We can think of these as having emerged to help organisms\n",
      "anticipate\n",
      "and adapt to cycles\n",
      "in the environment.\n",
      "So regarding anticipation,\n",
      "we have\n",
      "when the sun is up, the so called photoperiod,\n",
      "and when it's down, which is called the Scoto Period.\n",
      "You're probably familiar with the idea that organisms\n",
      "exist in different niches.\n",
      "Obviously,\n",
      "different animals live in different spatial niches.\n",
      "For example, they're aquatic organisms,\n",
      "like dolphins,\n",
      "there are terrestrial ones too, like\n",
      "humans,\n",
      "but we also exist in different\n",
      "temporal niches,\n",
      "and we can think of three broad categories of these. So one of them\n",
      "are diurnal or daytime active species,\n",
      "which includes\n",
      "humans.\n",
      "Another\n",
      "is the group of crepuscular\n",
      "species that are most active\n",
      "around twilight, so dawn and dusk respectively.\n",
      "And these include animals like rabbits and deer, and then there are nocturnal species,\n",
      "so things like bats and owls.\n",
      "When you think about these three broad categories, you'll realize that there are rush hours of activity in the animal world around dawn and dusk in which there's substantial crossover between these three distinct categories.\n",
      "And so what our clocks do is they predict when events in the natural world are going to happen\n",
      "each day.\n",
      "For example, dorm,\n",
      "and they set a timetable\n",

      "And regarding timing,\n",
      "how your body's clock responds to light can be plotted as what's called a phase response curve,\n",
      "which can be a little bit tricky to describe, but I'll do my best.\n",

      "In a phase response curve,\n",
      "the response to it doesn't just depend on dose, but also depends\n",

      "But we can all clotted relative to other markers of your body's clock, such as call body temperature.\n",
      "But ease, I'll explain how your body responds to light using the core body temperature rhythm.\n",
      "I mentioned earlier that there's a low point in your rhythm about two hours before you wake up. More precisely, it's probably about two point three hours on average two hours and eighteen minutes,\n",
      "but let's say it's two hours for our purposes here. And let's use an example of someone who naturally sleeps from midnight until eight AM. This person has their lowest call body temperature\n",

      "window,\n",
      "you will have the same effect on your clock, and actually light will most strongly influence\n",

      "If you're exposed to it about four hours before your call body temperature,\n",
      "low point\n",

      "from\n",
      "midnight until eight AM,\n",
      "that would be exposing yourself to lots of this type of light at about two AM. That will most substantially shift your clock later\n",
      "and your seat plates too.\n",
      "If you expose yourself to lots of intense light in the eight hours or so after the low point in your core body temperature rhythm, you'll tend to speed up your clock shifting it and your sleep earlier.\n",
      "This would be very helpful if you just flown\n",
      "six hours\n",
      "to the east, and you now have to\n",

      "Regarding how to shift your clock in this direction, light will most strongly\n",
      "accelerate\n",
      "your clock if it occurs about four hours after your core body temperature low point. So that's typically about two hours after your wake ups are returning to our example, that would be getting lots of light at about ten AM.\n",
      "While the phase response curve has been\n",
      "shown for light exposure.\n",
      "There's some preliminary evidence\n",

      "You should aim to get at least thirty minutes outdoors in daylight between about three hours before your target bedtime.\n",
      "And one hour before your target bedtime. So if your target bedtime was ten PM,\n",
      "then that would be between seven PM\n",
      "and nine PM.\n",
      "And if you're trying to shift your clock and, therefore, your speed,\n",
      "be physically active at those times of day when you're getting daylight because that might have some additive effects on the timing of your clock. If you're not trying to shift your clock timing, or if you're trying to shift earlier, definitely reduce your exposure\n",
      "to\n",
      "light in the three hours before bed. You want low\n",
      "amber lights at this time. Think of trying to mimic fire light in your indoor environment\n",
      "So some ways you could do this would be to use dimmers if you have them.\n",
      "Otherwise, rely on lamps instead of overhead lights\n",
      "And then during the sleep period,\n",
      "minimize the amount of light that reaches your eyes. There are a lot of people that would just mean closing the curtains,\n",
      "But for some people, that might mean using black outlines if they live in a very brightly lit neighborhood\n",
      "and or using an eye mask.\n",
      "Regarding your physical activity.\n",
      "Ideally avoid very strenuous activity\n",
      "in the one hour after waking and the three hours before bed. And if you have to exercise early, let's say that it's been three hours of waking,\n",
      "use a longer warm up at that time of day because your core body temperature is lower That will help your performance.\n",
      "The optimal time for performance in most activities\n",

      "I'll come back to those in a later podcast,\n",
      "but for now, I'll just say that while there's very little research on what the best time of day is for this type of exposure.\n",
      "If you try, I would avoid\n",

      "And probably also avoid it in the three hours before you go to bed at night. And the ideal time\n",
      "might well be in the early afternoon because that way you get a boost in your alertness, but it's also not so close to bed that it could that dramatically affect your sleep.\n",
      "Regarding heat exposure,\n",
      "I'm personally more bullish about the upsides of sawnies in cold water immersion,\n",
      "but I would still probably avoid it in the one hour after waking in the morning\n",
      "and the four hours before bed.\n",
      "Theoretically,\n",
      "it could probably be used slightly later than that.\n",
      "The issue is that you need time to rehydrate\n",
      "following high sweat rates while in a sauna.\n",
      "Regarding your nutrition,\n",
      "with respect to your calorie intake, it's really important to maintain a regular\n",
      "eating window each day, which is the time that elapses between when you first consume something that contains a substantial number of calories Let's just say that's fifty calories. And when you finish your last item each day, the sweet spot for most people, I believe, is an eating window of about eight ten hours,\n",
      "but it can be as short as six hours,\n",
      "particularly if you're trying to lose body fat, or if you're on a ketogenic diet and you're trying to accelerate\n",
      "entry into\n",
      "ketosis with no more than four on a given day,\n",
      "and this might sound a little bit difficult to pass, but I recommend allowing at least one hour before bed\n",
      "per unit consumed\n",
      "plus one hour. So to give you an example,\n",
      "a pint of beer is typically about two units\n",
      "So two units would be two hours, but then plus one hour, that would be finishing\n",
      "applying to beer,\n",
      "at least\n",
      "three hours before bed. If it was two pints of beer, that would be four units\n",
      "plus one hour. So that'd be finishing your two pints of beer at least five hours before bed.\n",
      "And that's to do with the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol.\n",
      "And then that brings us to fluid in general.\n",
      "There's not much evidence that things like water intake will affect the circadian clock, your biological clocks, but\n",
      "nevertheless,\n",

      "your patterns of fluid intake according to your sleep because obviously you don't want to continuously wake up during the night needing p.\n",
      "And in general, I think coinciding your final rinc of the day with your final calories of the day is a good starting point, but you might even want to cap your intake earlier than that.\n",
      "And then regarding medications,\n",
      "there are best times of there which to take certain medications.\n",
      "For example, it seems to be best to take ACE inhibitors, which commonly used to reduce blood pressure\n",

      "So\n",
      "ask your doctor if there's a best time of day which should take the medications that you've been prescribed\n",
      "That was a huge list of recommendations,\n",

      "In response to this,\n",
      "biological clocks evolve\n",
      "to predict these environmental cycles each day. And the biological clocks of our distant ancestors were probably closely aligned with the solar clock. Meaning they were awake,\n",

      "Most of the time that humans have been\n",
      "on earth,\n",
      "we lived by the solar clock and our biological clocks\n",

      "Human: does alchohol affect sleep? when should I stop drinking?\n",
      "AI: Yes, alcohol does affect sleep. Alcohol has the potential to disrupt the biological clock, which regulates sleep, at many different levels. Its impact, like that of caffeine and nicotine, is significantly influenced by dosage and timing. As a general rule, consuming alcohol earlier in the day is better for minimizing its impact on sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "The text provides specific recommendations about alcohol consumption in relation to sleep. It suggests that you should allow at least one hour before bed per unit of alcohol consumed, plus one additional hour. For instance, if you drink a pint of beer, which typically contains about two units of alcohol, you should finish drinking at least three hours before going to bed (two hours for the two units, plus one additional hour). This is due to the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol. If you were to drink two pints of beer, equating to four units, you would need to finish drinking at least five hours before bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines are designed to minimize the impact of alcohol on your sleep and ensure a better quality of rest.\n",
      "Human: is artificial light at night really all that bad?\n",
      "AI: Artificial light at night can indeed have negative impacts, particularly on sleep and overall health. The text discusses the potential detrimental effects of increased exposure to artificial light during the night. Over the years, artificial light at night has become more pervasive and intense. Research shows that it can disrupt sleep, and one simple solution to this is wearing an eye mask at night to block out the light. \n",
      "\n",
      "There may also be less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night. Studies have shown associations between artificial light at night and an increased likelihood of developing obesity in dozens of countries around the world. There's also potential evidence that artificial light at night could increase the risk of certain forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This is partly due to the disruption of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles and has mild anti-cancer properties. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the text does not suggest that all artificial light at night is harmful. For instance, it recommends using incandescent or warm white bulbs at night, with a color temperature below three thousand kelvin. These bulbs emit little short wavelength light, which can support high-quality sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, while it's not entirely bad, it's crucial to manage and limit exposure to artificial light at night to minimize potential health risks.\n",

      "and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that you spend at least an hour outdoors\n",
      "in daylight each day.\n",
      "So returning to those recommendations regarding light exposure that I gave at the start, I'll plug a few gaps now.\n",
      "At this point, I want to preemptively\n",
      "field a few questions that some of you might have. One of those is how do I get more daylight?\n",
      "And a few simple ways would be eat outdoors when you can. The moment here in the UK is the summer. So that is a real option, although the weather recently has frankly been pretty rubbish.\n",
      "Another is to go for short walks after meals, and you're not only gonna benefit from the light exposure then, but also things like the fact that you're being physically and that's going to improve your metabolic responses to those meals. And then another would be just park further from some of your destinations.\n",
      "So if you drive into work, for instance,\n",
      "maybe you park a little bit further from your workplace. Another question you might have is, what do I do if I live at a high latitude and during the long nights of winter, the sun is only out and for a couple of hours each day. It's a pretty good question. And in this instance, I would recommend perch seeing a SAD light or light box, and definitely get one that emits\n",
      "light and intensity of at least two thousand lux\n",
      "and it should contain plenty of short wavelength light. And frankly, most of these types of devices do. I have no affiliation with them, but here in the UK, for instance, there's a company named Lumi that makes good products.\n",
      "If you get one of these, then you want to be within one meter of it when you use it. And I wouldn't have it directly in front of myself, but instead just off at a slight angle.\n",
      "You use it for at least thirty minutes each day, but maybe sixty minutes\n",

So you're using it in the morning if you're trying to shift early or or in the evening if you're trying to shift later. And if you have seasonal effecting disorder, I would pretty much just follow the same advice that I just gave if you wanna try one of these devices, except for the the best time for seasonal effects order to use these is generally within a couple of hours away in the morning.\n",
      "Another question you might have is what types of light bulbs are best for my home?\n",

      "you want to use incandescent\n",

      "Another question you might have is what about screen time? I've heard that I shouldn't use my phone or iPad add or laptop\n",
      "or TV shortly before bed because it's gonna wake me up and shift my club later.\n",
      "Frankly,\n",
      "people tend to make too much of a fuss about this because since your central clock is affected by your recent history of life,\n",
      "exposure.\n",
      "If you spend plenty of time outdoors\n",
      "in daylight during the day, small amounts of light at night from these types of devices are going to have negligible effects on your clock and your alertness too. Nevertheless,\n",
      "I do think it makes sense to still dim the settings on these if you can. And if you don't mind them, then you can use\n",
      "certain apps to selectively\n",
      "filter out short wavelength light from these screens using two things like night shift mode. If you have an iPhone, night mode, if you have an Android phone, there's a software program named f dot luck that I use on my laptop that you can use too, and it just gives the screen an amber hue when the sun is down in your location.\n",
      "And these types of products do reduce the amount of short wavelength light emitted by screens.\n",
      "And theoretically, they, therefore, couldn't be slightly helpful. The problem is that looking at the research, a lot of people don't really like them, and they end up just disabling them after a short period of time. But If you don't mind them and I don't mind them, then there's no harm in using them whatsoever. And then finally on the subject of light, I just wanna mention some of these other non visual of light that I've alluded to, and I do want to address this subject in a lot more detail later. So we'll have a subsequent episode on how light affects other aspects of health, but just to give you some information\n",
      "about some of the other affects a light exposure on your biology. Many of these are positive. Getting plenty of daylight seems to help prevent myopia, so it's important your ability to see clearly and not end up being very short sighted as I used to be before Harigale's eye surgery.\n",
      "Another is affecting your cognition. There's fascinating work, for instance, showing that you can change office lighting to affect\n",
      "workers' performance\n",
      "Another is your mood, and if you've ever had seasonal effect disorder, then you'll know first hand how much light exposure can affect your mood. Another is your hormones,\n",
      "especially your sex hormones.\n",
      "One of the reasons why many of us feel a bit friskier in the summer seems to relate to the fact that we high levels of certain sex steroids at this time of year in response to greater UV radiation from the sun. Another is\n",
      "your metabolism.\n",
      "There's some preliminary research showing the patterns of light exposure we get after meals will affect how you respond to those meals in terms of things like blood sugar. And then another is\n",
      "your blood pressure.\n",
      "It seems that getting plenty of daylight might help push down your blood pressure by acting nitric oxide signaling\n",
      "in your vascular system. And then finally, your exposure to daylight will affect your vitamin d state which is the subject that tends to get the most headlines,\n",
      "and your vitamin d status is important to things like your bone health, but also your immune function too.\n",
      "The corollary of this though is that there are negative effects of excessive exposure\n",
      "to sunlight.\n",
      "One of those is, of course,\n",
      "sun induced skin damage, and and they put them through this type of circadian misalignment protocol. And they found that they still experienced worsening\n",
      "of their blood sugar control and their insulin action too. And so people don't seem to learn to accommodate this type of disruption over time.\n",
      "And then finally, thinking about clock disruption in the context of society at large. Let's turn our attention to the social clock. Starting with shift work, we know that shift work is associated with increased risk of various diseases, particularly night shift work. It tends to increase risk of certain cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke, type two diabetes,\n",
      "and maybe asthma too, going by some recent work, Some of this relates to clock disruption. Some of it also probably relates to sleep in general.\n",
      "And about quarter of shift work is experiencing they called shift work disorder, the circadian rhythm sleep weight disorder in which people\n",
      "struggle to sleep when they try because they're often\n",
      "sleeping\n",
      "at a time of day, which their biological clock is promoting ratefulness. And then when they have to be awake, they're really sleepy because sometimes the wage period overlaps with the biological nighttime, but also because since they haven't been sleeping very well, they have a residue\n",
      "of insufficient\n",
      "sleep, causing sleepiness\n",
      "that's then compromising their daytime functioning. That exemplifies how not just clock disruption that increases risk of some maladies and shift workers. And if you think about night shift work, it also entails increased exposure to artificial light at night. Increased calorie consumption\n",
      "during the biological nighttime increased stimulant use during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "more physical activity during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "strain social relationships,\n",
      "various other stresses that could contribute to health problems beyond disruptions, the clock itself.\n",
      "So regarding artificial light and night,\n",
      "this has increased in its pervasiveness\n",
      "and intensity\n",
      "in recent years. Going by satellite data. And we know that's associated\n",
      "with biased speech based on both cross sectional studies in which people look at the intense of light pollution in different areas and then ask people to self report their sleep, but also based on rigorous experiments.\n",
      "And A simple antidote to this night is to wear an eye mask. There was a nice experiment done recently showing they're doing, so it might not only improves sleep, but possibly benefit some aspects of cognitive function too. There might be some less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night as well. One of these is an increased propensity\n",
      "to develop the obesity. There have been associations team artificial itemized in obesity and dozens of countries around the world,\n",
      "but one of the better studies potential consequences of artificial light at night is an increase in risk of some forms of cancer and breast cancer specifically.\n",
      "Going by large scale epidemiological\n",
      "studies,\n",
      "in which people are again just looking at big groups of people where artificial light and night is taking place, and then who's getting cancer, It's hard to tell whether there is a signal there and whether that relationship does in fact exist.\n",
      "There are a few reasons to suspect that there might be some small effects.\n",
      "One is due to melatonin disruption.\n",
      "Melatonin seems to have some mild anti cancer properties\n",
      "those probably relate to both its effects on metabolic control,\n",
      "sleep, and immune function too. But light at night can probably disrupt hormones in other ways as well. And so I think we really need more research on that subject, but certainly, there are reason to suspect that there might be a real relationship there.\n",
      "Another form of societal clock disruption relates to people's chronotypes, whether they're morning likes or night outs. Spoke a bit about this in the previous episode, but sleep wake timing changes over the course of one's life span such that you probably will have experienced your late\n",
      "sleep wake timing then\n",
      "aim to get at least thirty minutes outdoors in daylight within two hours of waking,\n",
      "whereas if you're trying to shift your clock later,\n",
      "and this is often true of older adults.\n",
      "You should aim to get at least thirty minutes outdoors in daylight between about three hours before your target bedtime.\n",
      "And one hour before your target bedtime. So if your target bedtime was ten PM,\n",
      "then that would be between seven PM\n",
      "and nine PM.\n",
      "And if you're trying to shift your clock and, therefore, your speed,\n",
      "be physically active at those times of day when you're getting daylight because that might have some additive effects on the timing of your clock. If you're not trying to shift your clock timing, or if you're trying to shift earlier, definitely reduce your exposure\n",
      "to\n",
      "light in the three hours before bed. You want low\n",
      "amber lights at this time. Think of trying to mimic fire light in your indoor environment\n",
      "So some ways you could do this would be to use dimmers if you have them.\n",
      "Otherwise, rely on lamps instead of overhead lights\n",
      "And then during the sleep period,\n",
      "minimize the amount of light that reaches your eyes. There are a lot of people that would just mean closing the curtains,\n",
      "But for some people, that might mean using black outlines if they live in a very brightly lit neighborhood\n",
      "and or using an eye mask.\n",
      "Regarding your physical activity.\n",
      "Ideally avoid very strenuous activity\n",
      "in the one hour after waking and the three hours before bed. And if you have to exercise early, let's say that it's been three hours of waking,\n",
      "use a longer warm up at that time of day because your core body temperature is lower That will help your performance.\n",
      "The optimal time for performance in most activities\n",
      "is in the late biological afternoon.\n",
      "Probably five to hours before bed, and that coincides with the end of the working day for most people, which is quite convenient. And then otherwise just sprinkle,\n",
      "low to moderate intensity activity\n",
      "throughout the rest of your waking day.\n",
      "A lot of people now are interested it in things like cold water immersion\n",
      "and sauna use. So I wanna give some guidance regarding thermal stress as well.\n",
      "With respect to cold,\n",
      "it's not for everyone.\n",
      "I think a lot of people are seeing that it is nowadays because it's become so popular\n",
      "in recent years.\n",
      "But the narratives put forward by many people discussing the subject tend to be very imbalanced\n",
      "and disregard some real risks of cold water immersion in particular.\n",
      "I'll come back to those in a later podcast,\n",
      "but for now, I'll just say that while there's very little research on what the best time of day is for this type of exposure.\n",
      "If you try, I would avoid\n",
      "doing this within three hours of waste in the morning, if possible.\n",
      "And probably also avoid it in the three hours before you go to bed at night. And the ideal time\n",
      "might well be in the early afternoon because that way you get a boost in your alertness, but it's also not so close to bed that it could that dramatically affect your sleep.\n",
      "Regarding heat exposure,\n",
      "I'm personally more bullish about the upsides of sawnies in cold water immersion,\n",
      "but I would still probably avoid it in the one hour after waking in the morning\n",
      "and the four hours before bed.\n",
      "Theoretically,\n",
      "it could probably be used slightly later than that.\n",

And when you finish your last item each day, the sweet spot for most people, I believe, is an eating window of about eight ten hours,\n",

      "But ease, I'll explain how your body responds to light using the core body temperature rhythm.\n",

As a general rule, consuming alcohol earlier in the day is better for minimizing its impact on sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "The text provides specific recommendations about alcohol consumption in relation to sleep. It suggests that you should allow at least one hour before bed per unit of alcohol consumed, plus one additional hour. For instance, if you drink a pint of beer, which typically contains about two units of alcohol, you should finish drinking at least three hours before going to bed (two hours for the two units, plus one additional hour). This is due to the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol. If you were to drink two pints of beer, equating to four units, you would need to finish drinking at least five hours before bed. \n",

      "AI: Artificial light at night can indeed have negative impacts, particularly on sleep and overall health. The text discusses the potential detrimental effects of increased exposure to artificial light during the night. Over the years, artificial light at night has become more pervasive and intense. Research shows that it can disrupt sleep, and one simple solution to this is wearing an eye mask at night to block out the light. \n",
      "\n",
      "There may also be less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night. Studies have shown associations between artificial light at night and an increased likelihood of developing obesity in dozens of countries around the world. There's also potential evidence that artificial light at night could increase the risk of certain forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This is partly due to the disruption of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles and has mild anti-cancer properties. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the text does not suggest that all artificial light at night is harmful. For instance, it recommends using incandescent or warm white bulbs at night, with a color temperature below three thousand kelvin.

      "Bedtime restriction therapy, also known as sleep restriction therapy, is a behavioral treatment for insomnia. The main goal of this therapy is to improve sleep efficiency by restricting the amount of time spent in bed to match the actual amount of sleep a person is capable of getting. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Track Your Sleep: The person first tracks their sleep to determine the average amount of time they're actually asleep each night. For example, a person might be in bed for 10 hours but only sleep for 6 hours, resulting in a sleep efficiency of 60%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Restrict Bedtime: The therapy then involves restricting the amount of time spent in bed to match the average sleep duration. Using the previous example, the person would only spend 6 hours in bed each night. This restriction creates a mild sleep deprivation which helps to consolidate and improve sleep efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Gradual Adjustment: If sleep efficiency improves (usually to about 85% or higher), the amount of time in bed is slowly increased by about 15 minutes each week. This continues until the person finds their optimal sleep duration that results in feeling rested during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Maintain Regularity: It's important to maintain regular sleep and wake times throughout this process. This regularity helps to reinforce the body's natural circadian rhythm.\n",

Initially, she was more tired than usual, but her sleep efficiency improved significantly soon after. Over time, she was able to increase her time in bed while maintaining high sleep efficiency.\n",
