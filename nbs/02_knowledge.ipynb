      "Instead,\n",
      "I'll occasionally plug something that I admire has been valuable to me or just makes my day a bit better even though I have no affiliation with the product your company.

      "and this might sound a little bit difficult to pass, but I recommend allowing at least one hour before bed\n",
      "per unit consumed\n",
      "plus one hour. So to give you an example,\n",
      "a pint of beer is typically about two units\n",

      "at least\n",

      "There's not much evidence that things like water intake will affect the circadian clock, your biological clocks, but\n",

      "there are best times of there which to take certain medications.\n",

      "each day, preferably in the first half of your waking day. Why not take an early lunch\n",
      "break outdoors with others?\n",
      "● Limit your consumption of stimulants such as caffeine: Cap your intake at 2 mg caffeine\n",

      "caffeine-containing item by at least 9 hours before bedtime. Swap your caffeinated\n",

      "bedtime, finish moderate-intensity physical activity at least 2 hours before bedtime. Don’t\n",
      "worry, sex doesn’t count and often helps people sleep… so get busy.\n",
      "● Finish consuming all calorie-containing items at least 2 hours before bedtime. Stop\n",
      "consuming fluids at this time too if you’re prone to needing to pee during the sleep\n",
      "period.\n",
      "Notice that these guidelines are all relative to your sleep timing, not time of day. There are very\n",
      "(very!) large differences between people in how their sleep is affected by these stimuli, but try\n",
      "these guidelines to begin. Training\n",
      "Next there is training. Training commonly disrupts sleep by way of its timing and/or its load.\n",
      "Training timing\n",
      "If early or late training overlaps with your habitual sleep period (bearing in mind that it takes time\n",
      "to eat, get ready for training, travel to and from training, wind down from training, and so on),\n",
      "your sleep is likely to suffer. Ideally, you would adjust your schedule to avoid such overlap.\n",
      "However, if your training times can’t be changed then one option is to shift your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, respectively.\n",
      "To shift your sleep earlier, increase your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking for the\n",
      "day ahead. If you can’t expose yourself to daylight, use a light therapy lamp that emits a light\n",
      "intensity of at least 10,000 lux, and use it for at least half an hour. In the evening, avoid exercise\n",
      "in the 4 hours or so before your planned bedtime, and systematically reduce your exposure to\n",
      "light 2 hours before your planned bedtime. If you’re outside at this time and the sun is up, wear\n",
      "sunglasses. If you’re indoors, dim the lights (or turn some lights off) and perhaps use\n",
      "blue-blocking glasses. Finally, to go to sleep earlier, it’s probably best to at least temporarily stop\n",
      "consuming any caffeine during this phase. If you do these things, you should be able to advance\n",
      "your sleep timing by at least 30 minutes each day.\n",
      "To shift your sleep later, reduce your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking in the\n",

      "least 30 minutes each day. Note that regardless of whether you’re shifting your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, you should move your diet timing in lockstep with your sleep timing.\n",

      "Regarding training load, you’ve probably noticed that if you test the limits of your recovery your\n",
      "sleep soon deteriorates. Sleep problems are commonplace during overreaching and\n",
      "overtraining, and the problems generally subside once the balance between training load and\n",
      "ability to recover from training becomes more favourable. Addressing sleep difficulties during\n",
      "these periods entails modifying training loads (if possible) and being particularly fastidious about Pain and sleep in athletes\n",
      "To be the best they can be, athletes regularly test their capacity for physical discomfort. High\n",
      "training loads and injuries take their toll, and pain is rife in athletes. Left unchecked, poor sleep\n",
      "and pain can spiral in a vicious cycle in which poor sleep increases pain and reduces tolerance\n",
      "to painful stimuli, while in turn pain hampers sleep. Managing pain is key to maintaining healthy\n",
      "sleep in athletes, which highlights the critical importance of smart training. In addition, of the\n",
      "different strategies I’ve mentioned, meditation can be particularly helpful for coping with chronic\n",
      "pain.\n",
      "Mindset and competition\n",
      "Next, many athletes are perfectionists and experience high levels of anxiety about performance,\n",
      "especially around competitions, which may interfere with sleep. The strategies I discussed in the\n",
      "last blog should help with these ruminations.\n",
      "Competition does bring unique challenges, however. First, some events take place very early or\n",
      "late, and if this is the case then athletes should heed the advice above regarding how to shift\n",
      "sleep timing.\n",
      "Travel and sleep\n",
      "Competitions frequently entail travel, which can disrupt sleep in several ways. Sleeping in an\n",
      "unfamiliar environment routinely results in the “first-night effect”, a phenomenon in which we\n",
      "experience transient insomnia when sleeping in novel environments. This increased vigilance is\n",
      "thought to have evolutionary origins: you wouldn’t want to drop your guard for long in a place\n",
      "you’re not familiar with.\n",
      "Then there is jetlag, a subject I’d bet you’re all too familiar with. It would take multiple blogs to\n",

      "brief here. If you’re travelling across 3 or more time zones and plan to fully adjust to the new\n",
      "time zone, use the website jetlagrooster for guidance on how to optimise your exposure to light\n",
      "to overcome jetlag faster. At times of day when you are trying to avoid light exposure, wear\n",
      "sunglasses or blue-blocking glasses. Timely use of melatonin in conjunction with changes in\n",
      "your patterns of light exposure can additively shift the timing of your body’s clock. If you take\n",
      "melatonin, use conventional melatonin (not the timed-release stuff) at a dose of about 1 mg (this\n",
      "is a good product). before drinking or eating anything,\n",
      "either wearing the same item of clothing or not wearing any clothes at all. For a lot of people, they might want to do this once or twice a week.\n",
      "I recognize also that this isn't for everyone. If, for example, you've got a history of eating disorders or disordered eating, then it might not be for you. But if you are simply trying to maintain a new lower body weight, then this particular habit can be transformative.\n",
      "Another habit that I think is really helpful for a lot of people that I don't believe has come up in the podcast so far is\n",
      "matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity.\n",
      "Tommy spoke about the importance of spending sufficient time in bed, that is very relevant to most people.\n",
      "And frankly, many people benefit from spending slightly more time in bed, specifically\n",
      "if they have a history of insufficient sleep. They have some sort of lifestyle driven sleep loss. For example, they wake up to the alarm clock before work days and then they try and catch up on some sleep on the weekends.\n",
      "These people would benefit from extending their time in bed, perhaps by setting their alarm clock as late as possible,\n",
      "by increasing their exposure to daylight in the morning to shift their clocks early, which will help them fall asleep earlier by reducing their caffeine intake too.\n",
      "And perhaps by reducing their exposure to strong overhead lighting in the three hours or so before bed.\n",
      "For other people, though, specifically people with insomnia type symptoms.\n",
      "They actually benefit from spending less time in bed. One of the core treatments for insomnia is called bedtime restriction therapy\n",
      "or sometimes it's called sleep restriction therapy.\n",
      "Sometimes it's called sleep consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Regardless of what you call it, the idea is to only allow yourself the amounts of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis because what happens in insomnia is that people spend lots of time awake in bed trying to sleep and unable to sleep. So for example, if you spend ten hours in bed, but you're only asleep for six of those hours,\n",
      "then you might take six hours,\n",
      "add on thirty minutes because nobody is asleep from the moment they lie down in bed, So the moment they wake up in the morning.\n",
      "And then only let yourself have six and a half hours in bed and the way that you would practice, that would be by delaying your bedtime\n",
      "but waking up at the same time that you normally wake up in the morning.\n",
      "That will reduce the amount of time that you're spending awake in bed, and substantially improve your sleep quality in short order. Although, frankly, the first week or two will be very difficult because You might find that initially your sleep quality isn't that high and you are losing a bit of sleep. You might feel very fatigued during the day,\n",
      "But very soon, the improvements in sleep quality will more than compensate for the small reduction in sleep duration that sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Then in part two of my conversation with Simon, we spoke about problem versus emotion focused coping strategies.\n",
      "And how the people who most effectively\n",
      "cope with stress tend to use both of these types of strategies.\n",

      "of stress.\n",
      "For some people, that might be financial stress due to spending too much money on non essential things.\n",
      "For others, the stress might be from a toxic relationship.\n",
      "A helpful example of a problem focused coping strategy\n",
      "is called scheduled\n",
      "worry time.\n",
      "The idea here is that we're trying to compartmentalize\n",

And then finally on the subject of light, I just wanna mention some of these other non visual of light that I've alluded to, and I do want to address this subject in a lot more detail later. So we'll have a subsequent episode on how light affects other aspects of health, but just to give you some information\n",

      "and your vitamin d status is important to things like your bone health, but also your immune function too.\n",
      "The corollary of this though is that there are negative effects of excessive exposure\n",
      "to sunlight.\n",
      "One of those is, of course,\n",
      "sun induced skin damage, and and they put them through this type of circadian misalignment protocol. And they found that they still experienced worsening\n",
      "of their blood sugar control and their insulin action too. And so people don't seem to learn to accommodate this type of disruption over time.\n",
      "And then finally, thinking about clock disruption in the context of society at large. Let's turn our attention to the social clock. Starting with shift work, we know that shift work is associated with increased risk of various diseases, particularly night shift work. It tends to increase risk of certain cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke, type two diabetes,\n",
      "and maybe asthma too, going by some recent work, Some of this relates to clock disruption. Some of it also probably relates to sleep in general.\n",

      "sleeping\n",
      "at a time of day, which their biological clock is promoting ratefulness. And then when they have to be awake, they're really sleepy because sometimes the wage period overlaps with the biological nighttime, but also because since they haven't been sleeping very well, they have a residue\n",
      "of insufficient\n",
      "sleep, causing sleepiness\n",
      "that's then compromising their daytime functioning. That exemplifies how not just clock disruption that increases risk of some maladies and shift workers. And if you think about night shift work, it also entails increased exposure to artificial light at night. Increased calorie consumption\n",
      "during the biological nighttime increased stimulant use during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "more physical activity during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "strain social relationships,\n",
      "various other stresses that could contribute to health problems beyond disruptions, the clock itself.\n",
      "So regarding artificial light and night,\n",

      "and intensity\n",
      "in recent years. Going by satellite data. And we know that's associated\n",

      "And A simple antidote to this night is to wear an eye mask. There was a nice experiment done recently showing they're doing, so it might not only improves sleep, but possibly benefit some aspects of cognitive function too. There might be some less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night as well. One of these is an increased propensity\n",
      "to develop the obesity. There have been associations team artificial itemized in obesity and dozens of countries around the world,\n",
      "but one of the better studies potential consequences of artificial light at night is an increase in risk of some forms of cancer and breast cancer specifically.\n",
      "Going by large scale epidemiological\n",
      "studies,\n",
      "in which people are again just looking at big groups of people where artificial light and night is taking place, and then who's getting cancer, It's hard to tell whether there is a signal there and whether that relationship does in fact exist.\n",
      "There are a few reasons to suspect that there might be some small effects.\n",
      "One is due to melatonin disruption.\n",
      "Melatonin seems to have some mild anti cancer properties\n",
      "those probably relate to both its effects on metabolic control,\n",
      "sleep, and immune function too. But light at night can probably disrupt hormones in other ways as well. And so I think we really need more research on that subject, but certainly, there are reason to suspect that there might be a real relationship there.\n",
      "Another form of societal clock disruption relates to people's chronotypes, whether they're morning likes or night outs. Spoke a bit about this in the previous episode, but sleep wake timing changes over the course of one's life span such that you probably will have experienced your late\n",

      "the of the light that we're exposed to on these specialized cells.\n",
      "And that metric is named the melanopic equivalent daytime illuminance, which I mentioned on the episode\n",
      "with James Hewitt. And basically, since it's these Snellanops and containing cells\n",
      "that are key, we need a measurement\n",
      "that accounts for that. And the melanopic,\n",
      "equivalent daytime illuminance, isn't the same as the photoopic,\n",
      "equivalent daytime illuminance,\n",
      "which is what most people refer to lack which is a unit of light intensity.\n",
      "One lacks is the intensity of light that's emitted by one candle held one meter from the eye. Electric lighting,\n",
      "which is very good for letting us see,\n",
      "tends to stimulate these melanopsin containing cells less at a given level of illuminance than daylight does. That's one of the reasons why it's so important to spend plenty of time outdoors each day.\n",
      "Besides the wavelength of light though, it's spectral composition.\n",
      "The intensity matters too,\n",
      "and going back to luck\n",
      "The intensity of light in a well lit office\n",
      "might be around five hundred blocks. But even in the UK,\n",
      "On a sunny day\n",
      "around midday,\n",
      "the intensity light can get up to about a hundred thousand blocks. Two hundred times brighter\n",
      "than that well lit office.\n",
      "And while your visual system doesn't respond strongly to that difference, your non visual system does,\n",
      "and that's one of the reasons that I recommend that you spend at least an hour outdoors\n",
      "in daylight each day.\n",
      "So returning to those recommendations regarding light exposure that I gave at the start, I'll plug a few gaps now.\n",
      "At this point, I want to preemptively\n",
      "field a few questions that some of you might have. One of those is how do I get more daylight?\n",
      "And a few simple ways would be eat outdoors when you can. The moment here in the UK is the summer. So that is a real option, although the weather recently has frankly been pretty rubbish.\n",
      "Another is to go for short walks after meals, and you're not only gonna benefit from the light exposure then, but also things like the fact that you're being physically and that's going to improve your metabolic responses to those meals. And then another would be just park further from some of your destinations.\n",
      "So if you drive into work, for instance,\n",
      "maybe you park a little bit further from your workplace. Another question you might have is, what do I do if I live at a high latitude and during the long nights of winter, the sun is only out and for a couple of hours each day. It's a pretty good question. And in this instance, I would recommend perch seeing a SAD light or light box, and definitely get one that emits\n",
      "light and intensity of at least two thousand lux\n",
      "and it should contain plenty of short wavelength light. And frankly, most of these types of devices do. I have no affiliation with them, but here in the UK, for instance, there's a company named Lumi that makes good products.\n",
      "If you get one of these, then you want to be within one meter of it when you use it. And I wouldn't have it directly in front of myself, but instead just off at a slight angle.\n",
      "You use it for at least thirty minutes each day, but maybe sixty minutes\n",
      "timed as needed. So returning to what I was saying at the start, you might be trying to shift your clock earlier or later. In which case, you can I'm your use of this appropriately. So you're using it in the morning if you're trying to shift early or or in the evening if you're trying to shift later. And if you have seasonal effecting disorder, I would pretty much just follow the same advice that I just gave if you wanna try one of these devices, except for the the best time for seasonal effects order to use these is generally within a couple of hours away in the morning.\n",
      "Another question you might have is what types of light bulbs are best for my home?\n",
      "At night, certainly,\n",
      "you want to use incandescent\n",
      "or warm white bulbs.\n",
      "The lighting should ideally be\n",
      "indirect And he filed a couple of patents,\n",
      "went on to improve existing electric lights And then in eighteen eighty, the Edison Electric Light Company\n",
      "began making their first commercial electric light bulbs at scale.\n",
      "And as we'll get to you, this not only distracted people's biological clocks, it also enabled waiting behaviors.\n",
      "Such as eating\n",
      "at times of day when people's clocks were in fact promoting,\n",
      "resting, and sleep.\n",
      "And maybe most significantly, the emergence of these electric lights enable people to work round the clock. And so, our twenty fourseven shift working society was born.\n",
      "So nowadays,\n",
      "a third clock influences our lives more and more, and that is the social or society o'clock, which has enormous\n",
      "consequences for how we feel and function each day.\n",
      "We'll return turn to that social clock in a later episode.\n",
      "But for now, I just wanna zoom in on our biological clock.\n",
      "And why we have these in the first place.\n",
      "We can think of these as having emerged to help organisms\n",
      "anticipate\n",
      "and adapt to cycles\n",
      "in the environment.\n",
      "So regarding anticipation,\n",
      "we have\n",
      "when the sun is up, the so called photoperiod,\n",
      "and when it's down, which is called the Scoto Period.\n",
      "You're probably familiar with the idea that organisms\n",
      "exist in different niches.\n",
      "Obviously,\n",
      "different animals live in different spatial niches.\n",
      "For example, they're aquatic organisms,\n",
      "like dolphins,\n",
      "there are terrestrial ones too, like\n",
      "humans,\n",
      "but we also exist in different\n",
      "temporal niches,\n",
      "and we can think of three broad categories of these. So one of them\n",
      "are diurnal or daytime active species,\n",
      "which includes\n",
      "humans.\n",
      "Another\n",
      "is the group of crepuscular\n",
      "species that are most active\n",
      "around twilight, so dawn and dusk respectively.\n",
      "And these include animals like rabbits and deer, and then there are nocturnal species,\n",
      "so things like bats and owls.\n",
      "When you think about these three broad categories, you'll realize that there are rush hours of activity in the animal world around dawn and dusk in which there's substantial crossover between these three distinct categories.\n",
      "And so what our clocks do is they predict when events in the natural world are going to happen\n",
      "each day.\n",
      "For example, dorm,\n",
      "and they set a timetable\n",
      "of events in our bodies\n",
      "to align with these changes\n",
      "in the outside world.\n",
      "Thinking about this through an evolutionary lens,\n",
      "if our bodies were trying to do everything\n",
      "all at once all the time, then now be enormously\n",
      "energetically\n",
      "costly.\n",
      "Not only that.\n",
      "Having some things always on would be very detrimental\n",
      "to\n",
      "an example of this that comes to mind is\n",
      "If your immune system was always dialed up, then maybe that could contribute to problems such as auto immune conditions\n",
      "And so I'm gonna borrow another analogy from Till Ronerberg because I don't love the way that he frames many different subjects.\n",
      "But we can think of wakefulness as being like\n",
      "a formula one race\n",
      "and sleepers being a bit like a pit stop.\n",
      "And the pit stop happens a certain time in the twenty four hour day or a certain point in the race\n",
      "During that pit stop, we need to fulfill certain functions\n",
      "so that's restorative processes in your body. And in the case of the f one race, that would be things like replacing the tires,\n",
      "filling the tank, and so on. And if we think about the history of evolution,\n",
      "this pit stop has become more complex over time the same way that as the years have gone in racing cars have become more sophisticated.\n",
      "The pit stop has also\n",
      "changed as well.\n",
      "And so now the pro processes that take place in our body during the pit stop,\n",
      "more varied.\n",
      "And there's a question that has puzzled some scientists for a long time, which is why sleep would have evolved when it doesn't seem superficially to be adaptive in that we can't find resources like food while we're sleeping,\n",
      "we won't procreate and subsequently pass on our genes, but we can think of sleep as being the price that we pay for weightfulness. It's something that optimizes our bodies the light dark cycle, and\n",
      "it responds to light according to the spectrum of the light the intensity of the light and the timing of the light too.\n",
      "And regarding timing,\n",
      "how your body's clock responds to light can be plotted as what's called a phase response curve,\n",
      "which can be a little bit tricky to describe, but I'll do my best.\n",
      "In some ways, similar to a dose response curve, which you might be familiar with. In the dose response curve, the magnitude of your response to something depends on the dose of it. Consume\n",
      "more and more caffeine and you will feel more and more jittery.\n",
      "In a phase response curve,\n",
      "the response to it doesn't just depend on dose, but also depends\n",
      "on\n",
      "the timing\n",
      "of the dose relative to your body's clock, which in turn influences whether your clock shifts\n",
      "either forwards or backwards,\n",
      "and how much it does so.\n",
      "You can search for a phase response curve online if you like, but they're typically\n",
      "relative to your body's melatonin rhythm because your melatonin rhythm represents\n",
      "your biological day time and night time.\n",
      "But we can all clotted relative to other markers of your body's clock, such as call body temperature.\n",
      "But ease, I'll explain how your body responds to light using the core body temperature rhythm.\n",
      "I mentioned earlier that there's a low point in your rhythm about two hours before you wake up. More precisely, it's probably about two point three hours on average two hours and eighteen minutes,\n",
      "but let's say it's two hours for our purposes here. And let's use an example of someone who naturally sleeps from midnight until eight AM. This person has their lowest call body temperature\n",
      "at six AM.\n",
      "If you expose yourself to lots of intense light in the eight hours or so before this low point in the core body temperature rhythm,\n",
      "you'll tend slow your clock down,\n",
      "shifting it and enter your sleep later.\n",
      "So for example, that'll be ideal\n",
      "if you're trying to adjust\n",
      "having flown several time zones to the west, let's say that you've just flown from the UK\n",
      "to the East Coast of America.\n",
      "However, it's not just\n",
      "anywhere within this eight hour\n",
      "window,\n",
      "you will have the same effect on your clock, and actually light will most strongly influence\n",
      "the timing of your clock.\n",
      "If you're exposed to it about four hours before your call body temperature,\n",
      "low point\n",
      "And so for most of us, that will be about six hours before we would naturally wake up. Going bad to the example of someone's sleeping\n",
      "from\n",
      "midnight until eight AM,\n",
      "that would be exposing yourself to lots of this type of light at about two AM. That will most substantially shift your clock later\n",
      "and your seat plates too.\n",
      "If you expose yourself to lots of intense light in the eight hours or so after the low point in your core body temperature rhythm, you'll tend to speed up your clock shifting it and your sleep earlier.\n",
      "This would be very helpful if you just flown\n",
      "six hours\n",
      "to the east, and you now have to\n",
      "get up earlier each day and go to bed earlier too.\n",
      "Regarding how to shift your clock in this direction, light will most strongly\n",
      "accelerate\n",
      "your clock if it occurs about four hours after your core body temperature low point. So that's typically about two hours after your wake ups are returning to our example, that would be getting lots of light at about ten AM.\n",
      "While the phase response curve has been\n",
      "shown for light exposure.\n",
      "There's some preliminary evidence\n",
      "showing that this is relevant to physical activity\n",
      "too,\n",
      "and some scientists tried to plot a phase response curve for\n",
      "a certain type of exercise.\n",
      "Specifically,\n",
      "Sean Youngstead did a lovely study a few years ago and going by his research on this subject,\n",
      "if you exercise\n",
      "in the late evening between about seven PM and ten PM for most people,\n",
      "will tend to delay your clock slowing it down, shifting your sleep later. Whereas if you exercise\n",
      "in the first half of your waking day, more or less between about\n",
      "seven am and four pm for most people, you tend to speed up your clock shifting earlier. then\n",
      "aim to get at least thirty minutes outdoors in daylight within two hours of waking,\n",
      "whereas if you're trying to shift your clock later,\n",
      "and this is often true of older adults.\n",
      "You should aim to get at least thirty minutes outdoors in daylight between about three hours before your target bedtime.\n",
      "And one hour before your target bedtime. So if your target bedtime was ten PM,\n",
      "then that would be between seven PM\n",
      "and nine PM.\n",
      "And if you're trying to shift your clock and, therefore, your speed,\n",
      "be physically active at those times of day when you're getting daylight because that might have some additive effects on the timing of your clock. If you're not trying to shift your clock timing, or if you're trying to shift earlier, definitely reduce your exposure\n",
      "to\n",
      "light in the three hours before bed. You want low\n",
      "amber lights at this time. Think of trying to mimic fire light in your indoor environment\n",
      "So some ways you could do this would be to use dimmers if you have them.\n",
      "Otherwise, rely on lamps instead of overhead lights\n",
      "And then during the sleep period,\n",
      "minimize the amount of light that reaches your eyes. There are a lot of people that would just mean closing the curtains,\n",
      "But for some people, that might mean using black outlines if they live in a very brightly lit neighborhood\n",
      "and or using an eye mask.\n",
      "Regarding your physical activity.\n",
      "Ideally avoid very strenuous activity\n",
      "in the one hour after waking and the three hours before bed. And if you have to exercise early, let's say that it's been three hours of waking,\n",
      "use a longer warm up at that time of day because your core body temperature is lower That will help your performance.\n",
      "The optimal time for performance in most activities\n",
      "is in the late biological afternoon.\n",
      "Probably five to hours before bed, and that coincides with the end of the working day for most people, which is quite convenient. And then otherwise just sprinkle,\n",
      "low to moderate intensity activity\n",
      "throughout the rest of your waking day.\n",
      "A lot of people now are interested it in things like cold water immersion\n",
      "and sauna use. So I wanna give some guidance regarding thermal stress as well.\n",
      "With respect to cold,\n",
      "it's not for everyone.\n",
      "I think a lot of people are seeing that it is nowadays because it's become so popular\n",
      "in recent years.\n",
      "But the narratives put forward by many people discussing the subject tend to be very imbalanced\n",
      "and disregard some real risks of cold water immersion in particular.\n",
      "I'll come back to those in a later podcast,\n",
      "but for now, I'll just say that while there's very little research on what the best time of day is for this type of exposure.\n",
      "If you try, I would avoid\n",
      "doing this within three hours of waste in the morning, if possible.\n",
      "And probably also avoid it in the three hours before you go to bed at night. And the ideal time\n",
      "might well be in the early afternoon because that way you get a boost in your alertness, but it's also not so close to bed that it could that dramatically affect your sleep.\n",
      "Regarding heat exposure,\n",
      "I'm personally more bullish about the upsides of sawnies in cold water immersion,\n",
      "but I would still probably avoid it in the one hour after waking in the morning\n",
      "and the four hours before bed.\n",
      "Theoretically,\n",
      "it could probably be used slightly later than that.\n",
      "The issue is that you need time to rehydrate\n",
      "following high sweat rates while in a sauna.\n",
      "Regarding your nutrition,\n",
      "with respect to your calorie intake, it's really important to maintain a regular\n",
      "eating window each day, which is the time that elapses between when you first consume something that contains a substantial number of calories Let's just say that's fifty calories. And when you finish your last item each day, the sweet spot for most people, I believe, is an eating window of about eight ten hours,\n",
      "but it can be as short as six hours,\n",
      "particularly if you're trying to lose body fat, or if you're on a ketogenic diet and you're trying to accelerate\n",
      "entry into\n",
      "ketosis with no more than four on a given day,\n",
      "and this might sound a little bit difficult to pass, but I recommend allowing at least one hour before bed\n",
      "per unit consumed\n",
      "plus one hour. So to give you an example,\n",
      "a pint of beer is typically about two units\n",
      "So two units would be two hours, but then plus one hour, that would be finishing\n",
      "applying to beer,\n",
      "at least\n",
      "three hours before bed. If it was two pints of beer, that would be four units\n",
      "plus one hour. So that'd be finishing your two pints of beer at least five hours before bed.\n",
      "And that's to do with the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol.\n",
      "And then that brings us to fluid in general.\n",
      "There's not much evidence that things like water intake will affect the circadian clock, your biological clocks, but\n",
      "nevertheless,\n",
      "I think it is relevant to sleep, and you should modify\n",
      "your patterns of fluid intake according to your sleep because obviously you don't want to continuously wake up during the night needing p.\n",
      "And in general, I think coinciding your final rinc of the day with your final calories of the day is a good starting point, but you might even want to cap your intake earlier than that.\n",
      "And then regarding medications,\n",
      "there are best times of there which to take certain medications.\n",
      "For example, it seems to be best to take ACE inhibitors, which commonly used to reduce blood pressure\n",
      "in the evening, and that to counter\n",
      "the morning rise in blood pressure\n",
      "we experience each day.\n",
      "Another example is are various different arthritis drugs that are best taken around bedtime,\n",
      "including some glucocorticoids,\n",
      "and that's in part because of the daily patterns of symptoms that people experience.\n",
      "So\n",
      "ask your doctor if there's a best time of day which should take the medications that you've been prescribed\n",
      "That was a huge list of recommendations,\n",
      "and so now you can tune out and\n",
      "go about your day. But being serious, we'll explore the rationale behind each of those recommendations\n",
      "in-depth\n",
      "in due course\n",
      "But at this point, you might still be wondering\n",
      "what are these clocks that I'm banging on about are,\n",
      "and their associated\n",
      "rhythms\n",
      "And so let's now turn our attention to these.\n",
      "Biological clocks go way back to give you an idea of how far back cyanobacteria,\n",
      "which are the\n",
      "prokaryotic\n",
      "organisms\n",
      "thought to have first oxygenated\n",
      "the earth's atmosphere\n",
      "in the so called great oxidation event between about two and a half and two billion years ago actually have their own intrinsic clocks\n",
      "the emergence of these organisms was enormously consequential because by oxygenating the atmosphere,\n",
      "they allowed\n",
      "aerobic metabolism\n",
      "and the subsequent development\n",
      "of multicellular\n",
      "life.\n",
      "But thinking about our own species clocks and their relevance\n",
      "I'm gonna borrow a way of thinking about this from a great chronobiologist\n",
      "named Till Ronenburg.\n",
      "Think about this. Organisms evolved in the presence of some predictable changes in the environment each day, such as the rising and the setting of the sun. This is to solar clock or the environmental clock.\n",
      "In response to this,\n",
      "biological clocks evolve\n",
      "to predict these environmental cycles each day. And the biological clocks of our distant ancestors were probably closely aligned with the solar clock. Meaning they were awake,\n",
      "active, and eating during daytime and then resting and fasting at night.\n",
      "But while for\n",
      "Most of the time that humans have been\n",
      "on earth,\n",
      "we lived by the solar clock and our biological clocks\n",
      "That's no longer the case because,\n",
      "momentous change occurred in particular during the Industrial Revolution.\n",
      "And specifically,\n",
      "maybe the most consequential\n",
      "was the development of the incandescent\n",
      "light bulb.\n",
      "I believe a first light bulb was made by a guy named Humphrey Davies in eighteen o two, but obviously\n",
      "Edison is best known for bringing the light bulb to the masses.\n",
      "And he filed a couple of patents,\n",
      "went on to improve existing electric lights And then in eighteen eighty, the Edison Electric Light Company such as food security\n",
      "and biodiversity.\n",
      "At first,\n",
      "that might all seem far fetched,\n",
      "but it's actually not.\n",
      "And my goal for this series of podcasts\n",
      "is to give you a taste of why I fell in love with this science\n",
      "and to show you how you can act on this information\n",
      "to live a better life.\n",
      "Will cover a lot of ground\n",
      "and the details of each subject that I touch on could easily fill several books\n",
      "let alone a few podcasts,\n",
      "but I don't want this to be a deluge of esoteric information\n",
      "that sounds all smart and science y, but there's actually devoid of practical\n",
      "information\n",
      "and lacks any semblance of what matters in the grand scheme of things So along the way, I'll pepper this podcast with information that you can actually use to live better.\n",
      "And I'll even add a dash of BS behavioral science, of course,\n",
      "to help show you ways to seamlessly embed these ideas into your own life\n",

      "So if you want to try any of the things that I discussed,\n",
      "Maybe just think about making some small changes to your lifestyle step by step. Bear in mind the boring caveat that I'm not a medical doctor.\n",
      "I'm just that spent far too long university.\n",
      "So as needed, speak to your own doctor before you make any changes.\n",
      "I also want to be clear that I'm gonna focus on the majority of people in this series, namely people who don't work shifts\n",
      "or have circadian rhythms, sleep wake disorders.\n",
      "Everything that I'll speak about is relevant to these people, but subjects like ShiftWork are very complex,\n",
      "and I'd rather save them for a later date while also setting the stage for those episodes now so that we can hit the and running when we later turn to those episodes.\n",

Another question you might have is, what do I do if I live at a high latitude and during the long nights of winter, the sun is only out and for a couple of hours each day.

And if you have seasonal effecting disorder, I would pretty much just follow the same advice that I just gave if you wanna try one of these devices, except for the the best time for seasonal effects order to use these is generally within a couple of hours away in the morning.\n",

      "Another question you might have is what about screen time? I've heard that I shouldn't use my phone or iPad add or laptop\n",

      "Frankly,\n",

      "exposure.\n",
      "If you spend plenty of time outdoors\n",

If you have an iPhone, night mode, if you have an Android phone, there's a software program named f dot luck that I use on my laptop that you can use too, and it just gives the screen an amber hue when the sun is down in your location.\n",

And then finally on the subject of light, I just wanna mention some of these other non visual of light that I've alluded to, and I do want to address this subject in a lot more detail later. So we'll have a subsequent episode on how light affects other aspects of health, but just to give you some information\n",
      "about some of the other affects a light exposure on your biology. Many of these are positive. Getting plenty of daylight seems to help prevent myopia, so it's important your ability to see clearly and not end up being very short sighted as I used to be before Harigale's eye surgery.\n",
      "Another is affecting your cognition. There's fascinating work, for instance, showing that you can change office lighting to affect\n",
      "workers' performance\n",
      "Another is your mood, and if you've ever had seasonal effect disorder, then you'll know first hand how much light exposure can affect your mood. Another is your hormones,\n",
      "especially your sex hormones.\n",
      "One of the reasons why many of us feel a bit friskier in the summer seems to relate to the fact that we high levels of certain sex steroids at this time of year in response to greater UV radiation from the sun. Another is\n",
      "your metabolism.\n",
      "There's some preliminary research showing the patterns of light exposure we get after meals will affect how you respond to those meals in terms of things like blood sugar. And then another is\n",
      "your blood pressure.\n",
      "It seems that getting plenty of daylight might help push down your blood pressure by acting nitric oxide signaling\n",
      "in your vascular system. And then finally, your exposure to daylight will affect your vitamin d state which is the subject that tends to get the most headlines,\n",
      "and your vitamin d status is important to things like your bone health, but also your immune function too.\n",
      "The corollary of this though is that there are negative effects of excessive exposure\n",
      "to sunlight.\n",
      "One of those is, of course,\n",
      "sun induced skin damage, and and they put them through this type of circadian misalignment protocol. And they found that they still experienced worsening\n",
      "of their blood sugar control and their insulin action too. And so people don't seem to learn to accommodate this type of disruption over time.\n",
      "And then finally, thinking about clock disruption in the context of society at large. Let's turn our attention to the social clock. Starting with shift work, we know that shift work is associated with increased risk of various diseases, particularly night shift work. It tends to increase risk of certain cancers, coronary heart disease, stroke, type two diabetes,\n",
      "and maybe asthma too, going by some recent work, Some of this relates to clock disruption. Some of it also probably relates to sleep in general.\n",
      "And about quarter of shift work is experiencing they called shift work disorder, the circadian rhythm sleep weight disorder in which people\n",
      "struggle to sleep when they try because they're often\n",
      "sleeping\n",
      "at a time of day, which their biological clock is promoting ratefulness. And then when they have to be awake, they're really sleepy because sometimes the wage period overlaps with the biological nighttime, but also because since they haven't been sleeping very well, they have a residue\n",
      "of insufficient\n",
      "sleep, causing sleepiness\n",
      "that's then compromising their daytime functioning. That exemplifies how not just clock disruption that increases risk of some maladies and shift workers. And if you think about night shift work, it also entails increased exposure to artificial light at night. Increased calorie consumption\n",
      "during the biological nighttime increased stimulant use during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "more physical activity during the biological nighttime,\n",
      "strain social relationships,\n",
      "various other stresses that could contribute to health problems beyond disruptions, the clock itself.\n",
      "So regarding artificial light and night,\n",
      "this has increased in its pervasiveness\n",
      "and intensity\n",
      "in recent years. Going by satellite data. And we know that's associated\n",
      "with biased speech based on both cross sectional studies in which people look at the intense of light pollution in different areas and then ask people to self report their sleep, but also based on rigorous experiments.\n",
      "And A simple antidote to this night is to wear an eye mask. There was a nice experiment done recently showing they're doing, so it might not only improves sleep, but possibly benefit some aspects of cognitive function too. There might be some less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night as well. One of these is an increased propensity\n",
      "to develop the obesity. There have been associations team artificial itemized in obesity and dozens of countries around the world,\n",
      "but one of the better studies potential consequences of artificial light at night is an increase in risk of some forms of cancer and breast cancer specifically.\n",
      "Going by large scale epidemiological\n",
      "studies,\n",
      "in which people are again just looking at big groups of people where artificial light and night is taking place, and then who's getting cancer, It's hard to tell whether there is a signal there and whether that relationship does in fact exist.\n",
      "There are a few reasons to suspect that there might be some small effects.\n",
      "One is due to melatonin disruption.\n",
      "Melatonin seems to have some mild anti cancer properties\n",
      "those probably relate to both its effects on metabolic control,\n",
      "sleep, and immune function too. But light at night can probably disrupt hormones in other ways as well. And so I think we really need more research on that subject, but certainly, there are reason to suspect that there might be a real relationship there.\n",
      "Another form of societal clock disruption relates to people's chronotypes, whether they're morning likes or night outs. Spoke a bit about this in the previous episode, but sleep wake timing changes over the course of one's life span such that you probably will have experienced your late\n",
      "sleep wake timing then\n",

      "how your body's clock responds to light can be plotted as what's called a phase response curve,\n",

      "But we can all clotted relative to other markers of your body's clock, such as call body temperature.\n",
      "But ease, I'll explain how your body responds to light using the core body temperature rhythm.\n",
      "I mentioned earlier that there's a low point in your rhythm about two hours before you wake up. More precisely, it's probably about two point three hours on average two hours and eighteen minutes,\n",
      "but let's say it's two hours for our purposes here. And let's use an example of someone who naturally sleeps from midnight until eight AM. This person has their lowest call body temperature\n",

      "six hours\n",
      "to the east, and you now have to\n",

      "Regarding how to shift your clock in this direction, light will most strongly\n",
      "accelerate\n",
      "your clock if it occurs about four hours after your core body temperature low point. So that's typically about two hours after your wake ups are returning to our example, that would be getting lots of light at about ten AM.\n",
      "While the phase response curve has been\n",

      "There's some preliminary evidence\n",
      "showing that this is relevant to physical activity\n",

      "seven am and four pm for most people, you tend to speed up your clock shifting earlier. with no more than four on a given day,\n",
      "and this might sound a little bit difficult to pass, but I recommend allowing at least one hour before bed\n",
      "per unit consumed\n",
      "plus one hour. So to give you an example,\n",
      "a pint of beer is typically about two units\n",

      "applying to beer,\n",
      "at least\n",
      "three hours before bed. If it was two pints of beer, that would be four units\n",
      "plus one hour. So that'd be finishing your two pints of beer at least five hours before bed.\n",
      "And that's to do with the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol.\n",
      "And then that brings us to fluid in general.\n",
      "There's not much evidence that things like water intake will affect the circadian clock, your biological clocks, but\n",
      "nevertheless,\n",
      "I think it is relevant to sleep, and you should modify\n",
      "your patterns of fluid intake according to your sleep because obviously you don't want to continuously wake up during the night needing p.\n",
      "And in general, I think coinciding your final rinc of the day with your final calories of the day is a good starting point, but you might even want to cap your intake earlier than that.\n",
      "And then regarding medications,\n",
      "there are best times of there which to take certain medications.\n",
      "For example, it seems to be best to take ACE inhibitors, which commonly used to reduce blood pressure\n",

      "So\n",
      "ask your doctor if there's a best time of day which should take the medications that you've been prescribed\n",
      "That was a huge list of recommendations,\n",

As a general rule, consuming alcohol earlier in the day is better for minimizing its impact on sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "The text provides specific recommendations about alcohol consumption in relation to sleep. It suggests that you should allow at least one hour before bed per unit of alcohol consumed, plus one additional hour. For instance, if you drink a pint of beer, which typically contains about two units of alcohol, you should finish drinking at least three hours before going to bed (two hours for the two units, plus one additional hour). This is due to the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol. If you were to drink two pints of beer, equating to four units, you would need to finish drinking at least five hours before bed. \n",

      "AI: Artificial light at night can indeed have negative impacts, particularly on sleep and overall health. The text discusses the potential detrimental effects of increased exposure to artificial light during the night. Over the years, artificial light at night has become more pervasive and intense. Research shows that it can disrupt sleep, and one simple solution to this is wearing an eye mask at night to block out the light. \n",

      "There may also be less obvious consequences of exposure to artificial light at night. Studies have shown associations between artificial light at night and an increased likelihood of developing obesity in dozens of countries around the world. There's also potential evidence that artificial light at night could increase the risk of certain forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This is partly due to the disruption of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles and has mild anti-cancer properties. \n",

      "However, the text does not suggest that all artificial light at night is harmful.

      "1. Light Bulbs: Opt for incandescent or warm white bulbs in your home. These bulbs have a color temperature below 3,000 kelvin and emit less short wavelength light, which is more conducive to good sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lighting Placement: The lighting in your home should preferably be indirect. Instead of using bright overhead lights in the evening, use lamps with dimmer bulbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Screen Time: Limit the use of electronic devices like phones, tablets, and computers before bed which emit blue light. You can also use apps or settings that filter out blue light, like the night shift mode on an iPhone or night mode on an Android phone. Another option is to use a software program like f.lux on your laptop which gives your screen an amber hue when the sun is down in your location.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Environment: If you live in a brightly lit neighborhood, consider using blackout curtains or an eye mask to block out the light during sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Outdoor Exposure: Try to spend plenty of time outdoors in daylight each day. This can help regulate your body’s internal clock, reducing the impact of artificial light at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Appliances: Be aware of other sources of light in your home, such as from digital clocks or appliances. These should be dimmed or turned off where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the goal is not to eliminate all light, but to reduce exposure to intense, short-wavelength (blue) light in the evening, and promote exposure to warm, dim light.\n"

      "Bedtime restriction therapy, also known as sleep restriction therapy, is a behavioral treatment for insomnia. The main goal of this therapy is to improve sleep efficiency by restricting the amount of time spent in bed to match the actual amount of sleep a person is capable of getting. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Track Your Sleep: The person first tracks their sleep to determine the average amount of time they're actually asleep each night. For example, a person might be in bed for 10 hours but only sleep for 6 hours, resulting in a sleep efficiency of 60%.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Restrict Bedtime: The therapy then involves restricting the amount of time spent in bed to match the average sleep duration. Using the previous example, the person would only spend 6 hours in bed each night. This restriction creates a mild sleep deprivation which helps to consolidate and improve sleep efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Gradual Adjustment: If sleep efficiency improves (usually to about 85% or higher), the amount of time in bed is slowly increased by about 15 minutes each week. This continues until the person finds their optimal sleep duration that results in feeling rested during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Maintain Regularity: It's important to maintain regular sleep and wake times throughout this process. This regularity helps to reinforce the body's natural circadian rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example from the text is Amy, who had insomnia and was spending 10 hours in bed but only sleeping for 6. She started bedtime restriction therapy by limiting her time in bed to 6 hours. Initially, she was more tired than usual, but her sleep efficiency improved significantly soon after. Over time, she was able to increase her time in bed while maintaining high sleep efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "This therapy should be implemented under guidance and supervision, as it can initially lead to increased daytime sleepiness. However, in the long term, it can greatly improve sleep quality and efficiency.\n"
