      "AI: Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, getting enough sleep, and/or getting high-quality sleep, and also involves experiencing daytime impairment such as struggling to concentrate at work or living amidst an unwelcome cloud of anxiety. The text identifies two main types of insomnia: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Acute Insomnia**: Also known as adjustment insomnia, this is a transient difficulty sleeping that can be experienced occasionally. It can be caused by external factors such as jetlag or use of certain medications, or internal factors such as spikes in pain, psychological distress, or anticipation of important events. This type of insomnia generally resolves once the disruptive stimuli subside.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chronic Insomnia**: This type of insomnia can be caused by numerous factors including other sleep disorders (like sleep apnea), psychiatric disorders (including depression), consumption of medications (such as some antidepressants), drug abuse (including alcohol), medical disorders (like arthritis, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, kidney disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, prostate hypertrophy, and rhinitis), and poor sleep hygiene.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also refers to two subtypes of insomnia, which are sleep-maintenance insomnia (difficulty sleeping through the night) and sleep-onset insomnia (difficulty falling asleep). However, details about these subtypes are not provided in the text.\n",
