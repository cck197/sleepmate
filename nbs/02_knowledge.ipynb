Use bullet and numbered lists where appropriate. Be definitive with your response. Don't say anything that's not mentioned explicitly your knowledge. If you can't answer the question using the text, say \"Sorry I'm not sure.\" and nothing else. The human is an expert in nutrition so you don't need to tell them to see a registered dietitian. Your knowledge: Debra: There's not as much data as we would like, But at least all the data that we have to date, it looks fairly safe and easily tolerated. So it's not addictive. If we're thinking of it as a as a supplement to perhaps reduce your sleep latency, And allow you to get to sleep more quickly, which is quite, something that melatonin is used for, in older people. You know, it's not addictive, like, if you had if you were taking events or diazepine to sleep, for example. So I think it's about comparing, risks and benefits with what else you would give instead, that that would be one thought, About the Sleep, I like to separate children from adults. So we have never given melatonin to children, Because we were concerned, like you say, about the possible, reproductive effects pre puberty. But, of course, since, melatonin is available as a as a Sort of slow release preparation, 2 milligrams, and is available on prescription in the UK. The Prescriptions for melatonin in children have just soared like this. You can look at the data. It's incredibly popular. Difficulties, behavioral types of disorders, and very fragmented and disrupted sleep. So then it becomes a clinical decision, as to a way of perhaps calming down the Child and allowing. Because I always think of melatonin, it's not a sleep hormone. It is not involved in sleep, but it's Something that begins to rise naturally before you sleep. So it's the sort of telling your body prepare yourself for sleep. So I know that melatonin, is given to children, for example, before they go into a CT scan just to calm them down For All the Noise, there's a sort of calming, thing that that, children get from. And and and so I'm on the fence about, giving melatonin to children. I think parents Sometimes needed to to have some sort of normal lives for their other children and themselves. If you have a neuro a child who is severely neuro disabled, it's a clinical decision, I mean, whether it affects, the time of your puberty might might not be such a, you know, Driving decision here. Right? So I I I would leave it always up to the clinician, to and they will can prescribe according to what they've heard from the parents and the children about About melatonin and, and kids, the safety there's just not enough data. You know, as you say, it's available in health food shops. We've got millions of Americans taking melatonin every night just to reduce sleep latency. But, you know, we hardly get any side effects reported. So, you know, I know that's not evidence, but it's it's kind of counterargument that it is quite safe and if, you've got good purity, and especially if you're going long term like we do in our blind people. We've had our blind people back after years of taking melatonin done by some biochemical analysis on them, and nothing really has changed. So we're not picking up anything big, but, you know, that's as far as we are. I still think we still need A lot more work on that. Greg: I think your comments about there always being trade offs and considering what the are really important because if the alternatives are habit forming medications that lead to significant tolerance and withdrawal effects, and based on what you're saying about the biochemistry and so on, melatonin doesn't seem to lead to any stark changes over time. And if anything, kids might be slightly better behaved and maybe have slightly more consolidated sleep, then the net effect might be positive even if there were some very small effects on the timing of puberty. So we need to consider the whole picture, but I wanna use melatonin as non seamless segue to sleep and you spoke about how melatonin isn't a sleep hormone. It's really an internal signal of darkness. It's like an internal time cure, endogenous sight giver. Sleep-maintenance insomnia: how to sleep through the night In the previous blog, we briefly reviewed what insomnia is, as well as a few simple strategies you can immediately put to use to sleep better. In this blog we’re going to focus on how to sleep through the night. In doing so, I’ll discuss a few things we can all learn from the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, a disorder in which people wake frequently and for prolonged periods when they would rather be sleeping. So, if you’re tired of waking up at night, try these tips and let me know the results! Your daytime activities strongly influence your night-time sleep In a previous blog, Megan shared loads of tips about sleep hygiene. Here are some numeric guidelines for several particularly important sleep hygiene components: ● Get plenty of exposure to daylight: Aim to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors in daylight each day, preferably in the first half of your waking day. Why not take an early lunch break outdoors with others? ● Limit your consumption of stimulants such as caffeine: Cap your intake at 2 mg caffeine per kg body mass per day (use this site to estimate your intake), finishing your last caffeine-containing item by at least 9 hours before bedtime. Swap your caffeinated drinks for caffeine-free herbal teas. ● Whenever possible, avoid high-intensity exercise shortly before bedtime: finish vigorous-intensity and/or high workload physical activity by at least 4 hours before bedtime, finish moderate-intensity physical activity at least 2 hours before bedtime. Don’t worry, sex doesn’t count and often helps people sleep… so get busy. ● Finish consuming all calorie-containing items at least 2 hours before bedtime. Stop consuming fluids at this time too if you’re prone to needing to pee during the sleep period. Notice that these guidelines are all relative to your sleep timing, not time of day. There are very (very!) large differences between people in how their sleep is affected by these stimuli, but try these guidelines to begin. It's an important point. Every now and again, we get odd little papers out saying they've measured melatonin in every, health food shop in America and some have no melatonin in and some have Toning in and some have 10 times the amount, definitely, they're they're more reliable sources of than others. And we've always used a pharmaceutical prepared melatonin, so we're we're sure of the dose. And and and that that can be helpful. And and some of those preparations, if one reads the papers, you can get preparations, a good quality like that, but come coming back you know, we're already almost Overdosing when we take 1 milligram of melatonin. So if if you're if you only got 90% melatonin in that compound, It it's still gonna work, because we're well above, the the physiological Of melatonin. So I'm I'm not so concerned about whether the dose of melatonin might vary, if you want to take it For jet lag or shift work, but I'm more concerned about the purity if, for example, you're a blind person and you have Take it every day for the rest of your life, then I'd want a pharmaceutical company to prepare that because, you know, you don't want Any toxicity building up of for chronic use. Greg: Just to mention one of these studies specifically, there was an analysis done of melatonin products taken off the shelves in health shops in North America, and the concentrations of melatonin in the products varied about 80% less than what was on the label to 480% more than what was on the label, and some of them contain serotonin. Say, regarding your comment about purity, this is a real issue. And I think the supplement industry now is better regulated than it once was. But, ideally, you would certainly get a melatonin product that's been third party tested to ensure that it contains what it claims it contains, and there is a website named ConsumerLab where anyone can go and sign up and find out more about Purity. And if you look across different products, then I have no affiliation with this company. But the company Life Extension, their products always check out. So when recommending specific supplements, I tend to say life extension by default tend to contain what they actually say they do. And also just to mention something about the specific protocol that used in that study, Debra, I think you used 3 milligrams of melatonin in that study, and it was taken on non night shifts, and I think it was taken shortly before bedtime, and it showed that doing that reduced circadian misalignment and people experiencing the most circadian misalignment, and then that related some improvements in metabolic health too. So on that subject, I'd just like your thoughts on how safe melatonin is, because this is a subject that is now banded around by people who don't have the kind of expertise in melatonin that you do. And a lot of people make noise about how it could be bad for reproductive health, for instance, or if it's taken by young people, then it could contribute to some developmental issues, particularly with respect to, say, Tanner's stages of puberty and my impression having looked at the literature is that there's not actually much evidence of that. Certainly, melatonin strongly affects reproductive health and cycling in animals that are very photoperiodic. So I think of you, for example, I know that you've done some work looking at you specifically. How safe do you think melatonin is? Do you think that there are real causes for concern if the melatonin that's being used is pure Debra: Think about driving. When driving, if you see a red light ahead, your response is to put your foot on the brake to slow down. This is an example of stimulus (the red light) control of behavior (applying force to the brake). We are very efficient at forming these types of associations, which can work in our favour, as in this example. But sometimes the associations we form work against us, and this is often true of people who have sleep problems. Stricken by looming weariness, people who have insomnia often start spending more and more time in bed in the hope that doing so will help them catch up on sleep. The problem is that they reinforce an association between the bed (the stimulus) and wakefulness (the behavior). They need to break this cycle, which entails doing a few things: ● Saving the bedroom for sex and sleep only. ● Only going to bed when sleepy: If you’re yawning and struggling to keep your eyes open, you’re ready for bed. ● Applying the 20-minute rule: If you wake up at night and don’t then fall asleep within 20 minutes or so, leave your bedroom and do something relaxing and somewhat boring in a different room. Examples of these activities include meditation, doing a crossword, or reading a novel that isn’t riveting. Do not use devices such as phones, tablets, or laptops at this time. If you have insomnia and find it hard to drag yourself out of bed, make the process as easy and attractive as you can. Keep a dim light on in the other room, make sure the room temperature is comfortable, and leave your crossword out, for example. Just make sure that you expose yourself to as little light as possible during this time. And only return to bed when you’re sleepy once again. Sometimes, however, applying these strategies is still not enough. This brings us to bedtime restriction therapy (which is commonly referred to as sleep restriction therapy). Bedtime restriction therapy for sleep-maintenance insomnia Of all the interventions used to help people get over sleep-maintenance insomnia, one reigns supreme: bedtime restriction therapy. Frankly, this therapy is no fun. And I wouldn’t necessarily recommend that you try it without guidance. But it is very effective, and we can all learn from it. Let’s use a case study to show how it’s implemented. Greg: And, unfortunately, large proportion of research has been done on 20 year old men, but that is changing, so that's good news. And the subjects of light exposure, of course, brings up the subject of melatonin too, and one of the reasons that I mentioned the phase response curve is because you can also plot a phase response curve for melatonin ingestion, it's possible to use melatonin and light exposure to additively shift the person's clock. And when I think about Melatonin, Debra, without blowing smoke, I can think of few people other than yourself who have such deep expertise in melatonin as you do, so I think you're exactly the right person to be asking about this. But regarding that phase response curve, is it fair to say that the curve for melatonin and the curve for lights are roughly 12 hours apart. Debra: It is absolutely fair to say that. That's The simple message for everybody. So melatonin, in the morning will delay the clock, And melatonin in the evening will advance the clock. Exactly the opposite to what light does. Melatonin, At least in the all the studies to date isn't as effective as light in the amount of shifting that you get. It's about half the effectiveness of it. But I will say when I'm teaching on this, if You're taking melatonin and exposing yourself to light at the same time, you're doing the wrong thing. The 2 are canceling each other out. Greg: And I know that you've done some work looking at people who have lost their sight, and some of those people no longer have functional cells in the retina that are particularly important to relaying information about the light environment back to the master clock, and these cells are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. So for some people, melatonin might be more able to shift the clock because they no longer respond to light the way that the rest of us do. But regarding shift workers, you published some very interesting work, again, with Claudia. She's come up several times today a couple of years ago, looking at whether melatonin supplementation can improve metabolic health in night shift workers in part by reducing circadian misalignment, can you tell us about that? Because I think it is actually something that could be very practical for a lot of people if they can source good melatonin Debra: Yeah. Yeah. And this, you know, of course, our early work was on the blind and, Because they're not responsive to light, melatonin is their only option. And we showed very clearly that, in these blind, totally blind people, so no conscious perception of light, that melatonin daily can entrain their circadian system, and that that's been very helpful to them. It. In those days, we didn't know about peripheral clocks. And we we we weren't so focused on how clocks regulate metabolism. And so it it's only more recently that, We've begun to think about, melatonin's effect, on on on metabolism. And and this was a study of designed by by the first author, Lainie Marquez, From, Sao Paulo, and they gave, yeah, I remember being heavily involved in designing this protocol, we thought about it quite quite carefully. But we looked at markers that people hadn't looked at before like weight and overweight and and and things like this. And and melatonin certainly seems to, have some potential, with that, in the study, it it it was found to be useful. It was a placebo controlled study. It. Yeah. You mentioned the quality of the melatonin. But, you know, to really prove it's working as a bona fide time giver it needs to do both. That's the definition. And and, of course, light can do both, and melatonin can do both. Greg: And it might be that there are some other dietary constituents that could help shift workers that aren't so widely discussed, that they are getting more attention now Debra, I remember having conversation with you years ago about creating monohydrate. Something that I've been excited of probably since I was about 16 and took it for the 1st time, but that was because I was interested in getting stronger and looking better for girls. It but since then, we now know that creatine is good for the brain in many ways. And when you look at homeostatic sleep drive, which is that hunger for sleep that accumulates with increasing time awake, then the main correlate of that seems to be the concentration of adenosine between cells in the brain. And by taking creatine monohydrate, you can increase creatine stores in the brain and going by some studies of nonhuman animals, rats specifically, adding creatine monohydrate to the chow of rats seems to reduce the accumulation of adenosine in the brain, and then in accordance with that, the rats sleep less, their sleep is less deep and they have less rebound sleep after sleep deprivation, so whereas 1 rat who hadn't had creatine in their chow would sleep a lot longer following sleep deprivation, the rat that has creatine monohydrate in the chow doesn't have that same substantial increase in their sleep when they are eventually allowed to sleep, which is really interesting, and this hasn't been well studied in humans yet, but there's some evidence suggesting that creatine can help offset some of the negative effects of insufficiency, in particular, on some proxies of cognitive function and on some quite simple motor skills too. So I think creatine monohydrate is definitely something that could be really relevant to a lot of shift workers, and it's something that we know to be very safe and to generally be good for the health of people so I actually feel quite comfortable saying that taking in a 5 gram dose of creatine monohydrate per day with AMEA, it's probably not a bad option for shift workers. And then the other substance that I think is quite interesting is L Tyrosine, which is an amino acid precursor of the neuromodulators, noradrenaline and dopamine. And during extended wakefulness, the brain is, of course, under a substantial amount of stress, and noradrenaline and dopamine get turned over faster than worsely permitted, and to support that increased turnover, you can supplement L Tyrosine. And by providing additional precursory, you can probably help maintain levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain in levels that are closer to optimal. And while the research on this subject is very much in its infancy, that again seems to help maintain some cognitive functions during sleep deprivation or sleep restriction, once again, it's relatively safe. It's something that most of us consume by way of our diets. Anyway, you probably only need 1 or 2 grams of it a day. I mentioned those in part to transition us now to nutrition, Debra, because you spoke then about nutrition and physical activity as time cues for the circadian system and probably different clocks in the circadian system. You published what, in my opinion, is probably the best study to date looking at whether diet timing is a time cue for some clocks in the circadian system. This was a paper that came out in 2017 in Current Biology, can you tell us about this? It's a wonderful study that people should read if they're interested. Debra: Thank you. Yes. In collaboration, of course, Jonathan Johnston was the PI on that study and Sophie Varens is the first name. She was our postdoc. It. Having trouble sleeping? A primer on insomnia and how to sleep better Having trouble sleeping? Rest assured, you aren’t alone: 50 million to 70 million adults in the US alone have sleep disorders, among which insomnia is the most prevalent. At a given time, short-term insomnia erodes the lives of about 30% of US adults. Chronic insomnia afflicts about 10% more. That’s a lot of people. We’re therefore going to focus on how to overcome insomnia in this blog series. However, regardless of your sleep problems, I’m going to try to help you identify and address the key contributors to your sleep problems. We’ll begin by briefly reviewing what insomnia is. In subsequent blogs, we’ll turn our attention to two subtypes of insomnia: sleep-maintenance insomnia (difficulty sleeping through the night) and sleep-onset insomnia (difficulty falling asleep). As an NBT reader, you’re probably unusually fond of testing the limits of your physical performance, so we’ll end with a discussion of the complex relationship between exercise and sleep, as well as some of the particular challenges that athletes face. Throughout the series, I’ll give you some practical tips you can use to enhance your sleep, building on multiple podcasts (such as this one) and a comprehensive previous blog that Megan wrote. To supplement these blogs, Chris and I will also record a podcast. Let’s get to it! What is insomnia, anyway? If you have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, getting enough sleep, and/or getting high-quality sleep, you may have insomnia. To be diagnosed with insomnia, you must experience daytime impairment too, which often entails struggling to concentrate at work or living amidst an unwelcome cloud of anxiety. There are actually numerous sub-categories of insomnia, but we’ll divide them into two: too. These apps aren’t sleep-specific, but I’m confident that using them will help many people sleep better. There are of course numerous excellent mindfulness teachers who run in-person events too, and in-person training is worth exploring if you have the time and the will. Because I don’t know where you live, it’s hard to point you in the direction of teachers though, I’m afraid. Wake up to your values Please note that the metacognitive model of insomnia is not just about mindfulness and acceptance though - it is also about using your values to guide your behaviors. If your anxiety about your poor sleep is affecting your commitment to important aspects of your life, you may benefit from taking some time to clarify your core values. If you truly value being a good friend and it’s your buddy’s birthday on Friday night, you’re not going to skip the party entirely to try and catch up on sleep, right? There are some simple tools out there to help you identify your core values. As a starting point, try the bull’s eye (page 3) and/or the Life Compass (page 5) exercise(s) in this resource. Doing so may be time very well spent for you! Okay, hopefully some of the above help you with your cognitions. But what about other common impediments to falling sleep? How to get to sleep fast when your heart is pounding Many people who have insomnia are particularly highly attuned to their bodily sensations. Am I falling asleep? Man, my heart is pounding… again. If you can relate to this problem, you’ll probably find visualisation useful. Visualisation is a skill that you should first hone during the daytime. To try it, imagine a scene that you find deeply relaxing. Where are you? Who are you with?\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mSystem: A human is asking the following question delimited by triple backticks: Question: ```what does melatonin do?``` In a couple of paragraphs, answer the question. Use bullet and numbered lists where appropriate. Be definitive with your response. Don't say anything that's not mentioned explicitly your knowledge. If you can't answer the question using the text, say \"Sorry I'm not sure.\" and nothing else. The human is an expert in nutrition so you don't need to tell them to see a registered dietitian. Your knowledge: It's an important point. Every now and again, we get odd little papers out saying they've measured melatonin in every, health food shop in America and some have no melatonin in and some have Toning in and some have 10 times the amount, definitely, they're they're more reliable sources of than others. And we've always used a pharmaceutical prepared melatonin, so we're we're sure of the dose. And and and that that can be helpful. And and some of those preparations, if one reads the papers, you can get preparations, a good quality like that, but come coming back you know, we're already almost Overdosing when we take 1 milligram of melatonin. So if if you're if you only got 90% melatonin in that compound, It it's still gonna work, because we're well above, the the physiological Of melatonin. So I'm I'm not so concerned about whether the dose of melatonin might vary, if you want to take it For jet lag or shift work, but I'm more concerned about the purity if, for example, you're a blind person and you have Take it every day for the rest of your life, then I'd want a pharmaceutical company to prepare that because, you know, you don't want Any toxicity building up of for chronic use. Greg: Just to mention one of these studies specifically, there was an analysis done of melatonin products taken off the shelves in health shops in North America, and the concentrations of melatonin in the products varied about 80% less than what was on the label to 480% more than what was on the label, and some of them contain serotonin. Say, regarding your comment about purity, this is a real issue. And I think the supplement industry now is better regulated than it once was. But, ideally, you would certainly get a melatonin product that's been third party tested to ensure that it contains what it claims it contains, and there is a website named ConsumerLab where anyone can go and sign up and find out more about Purity. And if you look across different products, then I have no affiliation with this company. But the company Life Extension, their products always check out. So when recommending specific supplements, I tend to say life extension by default tend to contain what they actually say they do. And also just to mention something about the specific protocol that used in that study, Debra, I think you used 3 milligrams of melatonin in that study, and it was taken on non night shifts, and I think it was taken shortly before bedtime, and it showed that doing that reduced circadian misalignment and people experiencing the most circadian misalignment, and then that related some improvements in metabolic health too. So on that subject, I'd just like your thoughts on how safe melatonin is, because this is a subject that is now banded around by people who don't have the kind of expertise in melatonin that you do. And a lot of people make noise about how it could be bad for reproductive health, for instance, or if it's taken by young people, then it could contribute to some developmental issues, particularly with respect to, say, Tanner's stages of puberty and my impression having looked at the literature is that there's not actually much evidence of that. Certainly, melatonin strongly affects reproductive health and cycling in animals that are very photoperiodic. So I think of you, for example, I know that you've done some work looking at you specifically. How safe do you think melatonin is? Do you think that there are real causes for concern if the melatonin that's being used is pure Debra: Greg: And, unfortunately, large proportion of research has been done on 20 year old men, but that is changing, so that's good news. And the subjects of light exposure, of course, brings up the subject of melatonin too, and one of the reasons that I mentioned the phase response curve is because you can also plot a phase response curve for melatonin ingestion, it's possible to use melatonin and light exposure to additively shift the person's clock. And when I think about Melatonin, Debra, without blowing smoke, I can think of few people other than yourself who have such deep expertise in melatonin as you do, so I think you're exactly the right person to be asking about this. But regarding that phase response curve, is it fair to say that the curve for melatonin and the curve for lights are roughly 12 hours apart. Debra: It is absolutely fair to say that. That's The simple message for everybody. So melatonin, in the morning will delay the clock, And melatonin in the evening will advance the clock. Exactly the opposite to what light does. Melatonin, At least in the all the studies to date isn't as effective as light in the amount of shifting that you get. It's about half the effectiveness of it. But I will say when I'm teaching on this, if You're taking melatonin and exposing yourself to light at the same time, you're doing the wrong thing. The 2 are canceling each other out. Greg: And I know that you've done some work looking at people who have lost their sight, and some of those people no longer have functional cells in the retina that are particularly important to relaying information about the light environment back to the master clock, and these cells are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. So for some people, melatonin might be more able to shift the clock because they no longer respond to light the way that the rest of us do. But regarding shift workers, you published some very interesting work, again, with Claudia. She's come up several times today a couple of years ago, looking at whether melatonin supplementation can improve metabolic health in night shift workers in part by reducing circadian misalignment, can you tell us about that? Because I think it is actually something that could be very practical for a lot of people if they can source good melatonin Debra: Yeah. Yeah. And this, you know, of course, our early work was on the blind and, Because they're not responsive to light, melatonin is their only option. And we showed very clearly that, in these blind, totally blind people, so no conscious perception of light, that melatonin daily can entrain their circadian system, and that that's been very helpful to them. It. In those days, we didn't know about peripheral clocks. And we we we weren't so focused on how clocks regulate metabolism. And so it it's only more recently that, We've begun to think about, melatonin's effect, on on on metabolism. And and this was a study of designed by by the first author, Lainie Marquez, From, Sao Paulo, and they gave, yeah, I remember being heavily involved in designing this protocol, we thought about it quite quite carefully. But we looked at markers that people hadn't looked at before like weight and overweight and and and things like this. And and melatonin certainly seems to, have some potential, with that, in the study, it it it was found to be useful. It was a placebo controlled study. It. Yeah. You mentioned the quality of the melatonin. Debra: There's not as much data as we would like, But at least all the data that we have to date, it looks fairly safe and easily tolerated. So it's not addictive. If we're thinking of it as a as a supplement to perhaps reduce your sleep latency, And allow you to get to sleep more quickly, which is quite, something that melatonin is used for, in older people. You know, it's not addictive, like, if you had if you were taking events or diazepine to sleep, for example. So I think it's about comparing, risks and benefits with what else you would give instead, that that would be one thought, About the Sleep, I like to separate children from adults. So we have never given melatonin to children, Because we were concerned, like you say, about the possible, reproductive effects pre puberty. But, of course, since, melatonin is available as a as a Sort of slow release preparation, 2 milligrams, and is available on prescription in the UK. The Prescriptions for melatonin in children have just soared like this. You can look at the data. It's incredibly popular. Difficulties, behavioral types of disorders, and very fragmented and disrupted sleep. So then it becomes a clinical decision, as to a way of perhaps calming down the Child and allowing. Because I always think of melatonin, it's not a sleep hormone. It is not involved in sleep, but it's Something that begins to rise naturally before you sleep. So it's the sort of telling your body prepare yourself for sleep. So I know that melatonin, is given to children, for example, before they go into a CT scan just to calm them down For All the Noise, there's a sort of calming, thing that that, children get from. And and and so I'm on the fence about, giving melatonin to children. I think parents Sometimes needed to to have some sort of normal lives for their other children and themselves. If you have a neuro a child who is severely neuro disabled, it's a clinical decision, I mean, whether it affects, the time of your puberty might might not be such a, you know, Driving decision here. Right? So I I I would leave it always up to the clinician, to and they will can prescribe according to what they've heard from the parents and the children about About melatonin and, and kids, the safety there's just not enough data. You know, as you say, it's available in health food shops. We've got millions of Americans taking melatonin every night just to reduce sleep latency. But, you know, we hardly get any side effects reported. So, you know, I know that's not evidence, but it's it's kind of counterargument that it is quite safe and if, you've got good purity, and especially if you're going long term like we do in our blind people. We've had our blind people back after years of taking melatonin done by some biochemical analysis on them, and nothing really has changed. So we're not picking up anything big, but, you know, that's as far as we are. I still think we still need A lot more work on that. Greg: I think your comments about there always being trade offs and considering what the are really important because if the alternatives are habit forming medications that lead to significant tolerance and withdrawal effects, and based on what you're saying about the biochemistry and so on, melatonin doesn't seem to lead to any stark changes over time. And if anything, kids might be slightly better behaved and maybe have slightly more consolidated sleep, then the net effect might be positive even if there were some very small effects on the timing of puberty. So we need to consider the whole picture, but I wanna use melatonin as non seamless segue to sleep and you spoke about how melatonin isn't a sleep hormone. It's really an internal signal of darkness. It's like an internal time cure, endogenous sight giver. But, you know, to really prove it's working as a bona fide time giver it needs to do both. That's the definition. And and, of course, light can do both, and melatonin can do both. Greg: And it might be that there are some other dietary constituents that could help shift workers that aren't so widely discussed, that they are getting more attention now Debra, I remember having conversation with you years ago about creating monohydrate. Something that I've been excited of probably since I was about 16 and took it for the 1st time, but that was because I was interested in getting stronger and looking better for girls. It but since then, we now know that creatine is good for the brain in many ways. And when you look at homeostatic sleep drive, which is that hunger for sleep that accumulates with increasing time awake, then the main correlate of that seems to be the concentration of adenosine between cells in the brain. And by taking creatine monohydrate, you can increase creatine stores in the brain and going by some studies of nonhuman animals, rats specifically, adding creatine monohydrate to the chow of rats seems to reduce the accumulation of adenosine in the brain, and then in accordance with that, the rats sleep less, their sleep is less deep and they have less rebound sleep after sleep deprivation, so whereas 1 rat who hadn't had creatine in their chow would sleep a lot longer following sleep deprivation, the rat that has creatine monohydrate in the chow doesn't have that same substantial increase in their sleep when they are eventually allowed to sleep, which is really interesting, and this hasn't been well studied in humans yet, but there's some evidence suggesting that creatine can help offset some of the negative effects of insufficiency, in particular, on some proxies of cognitive function and on some quite simple motor skills too. So I think creatine monohydrate is definitely something that could be really relevant to a lot of shift workers, and it's something that we know to be very safe and to generally be good for the health of people so I actually feel quite comfortable saying that taking in a 5 gram dose of creatine monohydrate per day with AMEA, it's probably not a bad option for shift workers. And then the other substance that I think is quite interesting is L Tyrosine, which is an amino acid precursor of the neuromodulators, noradrenaline and dopamine. And during extended wakefulness, the brain is, of course, under a substantial amount of stress, and noradrenaline and dopamine get turned over faster than worsely permitted, and to support that increased turnover, you can supplement L Tyrosine. And by providing additional precursory, you can probably help maintain levels of noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain in levels that are closer to optimal. And while the research on this subject is very much in its infancy, that again seems to help maintain some cognitive functions during sleep deprivation or sleep restriction, once again, it's relatively safe. It's something that most of us consume by way of our diets. Anyway, you probably only need 1 or 2 grams of it a day. I mentioned those in part to transition us now to nutrition, Debra, because you spoke then about nutrition and physical activity as time cues for the circadian system and probably different clocks in the circadian system. You published what, in my opinion, is probably the best study to date looking at whether diet timing is a time cue for some clocks in the circadian system. This was a paper that came out in 2017 in Current Biology, can you tell us about this? It's a wonderful study that people should read if they're interested. Debra: Thank you. Yes. In collaboration, of course, Jonathan Johnston was the PI on that study and Sophie Varens is the first name. She was our postdoc. It. So it could be better to go for regular doses of, say, up to 50 milligrams of caffeine consumed every couple of hours than consuming a heroic dose of caffeine at the very start of the shift schedule. I know that there's some, albeit limited work, suggesting that caffeine might independently be able to slightly shift the timing of somebody's body's clock and maybe the best demonstration of this that I'm aware of is a study that was published by Tina Burke and Ken Wright a few years ago and they gave participants 2.9 milligrams of caffeine per kilo, so if you were 80 kilos, that's roughly 240 grams of caffeine, so it's a large dose that's like 2 store bought Americanos 3 hours before their bedtimes and they found that that shifted people's melatonin rhythms by about 40 minutes later, and then they did some mechanistic work to try and understand what some of the biological bases of that might be, are you aware of anyone having tried to plot a phase response curve for Caffeine Debra, I'm just thinking if somebody takes caffeine shortly after waking in the morning and they're taking it in early circadian phase not long after their core body temperature minimum, then I wouldn't expect that to delay their clock, and I'm not aware of any evidence that shows that, but I haven't seen somebody try to systematically plot a phase response curve for caffeine using appropriate methods. Debra: Yeah. You're absolutely right. I mean, when Ken Ken Wright's paper that you're talking about came out, I mean, my first, thought was, oh, it's a pity they only gave one dose at a single time point, and, of course so the obvious question is at different times of the day, what effect that would have. So we we are, I think, in need of a face response curve to caffeine, because if it really is affecting the clock, then it should have a phase response curve because that is the definition. If you need to synchronize a clock, you need Venetian, if you need to synchronize a clock, you need to be able to delay the clock and advance the clock, else Synchronization doesn't work. Okay? So they've shown one way that it delays. And so if it's really affecting and I think they've tried to say it was affecting the SCN clock, right, then it should also advance. Dance. That's the that's the story. If it doesn't advance, then it's not really a time cue, Zikeba. There's something else going on. And and we we can say the same about exercise now, or about food. You know, people have given food at a set time and measured what what it does to the clock. People have given exercise at a set time what it does to the clock. But, you know, to really prove it's working as a bona fide time giver it needs to do both. That's the definition. And and, of course, light can do both, and melatonin can do both. Greg: sleepiness while watching the low melanopic EDI screen.87 The clinical significance of such effects and whether physiological differences in melatonin production influence subsequent sleep is not yet clear, however. 88 It is clear that in many instances peri-sleep screen time has repercussions. However, advances in technology can help thwart these detrimental effects, and we note that some of the content these devices deliver actually support sleep, as in the case of using smartphones for relaxing exercises, such as slow-paced breathing drills that emphasise exhalation89 Effects of ambient temperature on sleep In natural settings, changes in light exposure contribute to changes in thermal conditions. Globally, ambient temperature (AT) fluctuations are getting more extreme, which threatens the health of many organisms worldwide, including humans.90 Furthermore, climate change-driven increases in temperature are exacerbated by urbanization and global development.91 Increased propensity to sleep disturbances could follow this, particularly since in many places night-time AT are rising more than daytime temperature.92 Indeed, large-scale cross-sectional research indicates that higher night-time AT are associated with insufficient sleep, which might become more burdensome in years to come.93 For instance, among people with sleep-disordered breathing, higher temperatures and ozone concentrations are positively associated with apnea-hypopnea index, a proxy of the presence and severity of apnea.94 Concerning the biological bases of how temperature affects sleep, it is helpful — if simplistic — to conceputualize the human thermoregulatory system as comprising a heat-generating, homeothermic core inside a shell that regulates heat loss. Information about the thermal environment from cold and warm receptors in the skin of the shell continuously updates the brain about ambient conditions. Since excessively high or low AT can threaten homeostasis, the brain modifies vigilance according to information about the thermal environment, so temperatures outside the thermal comfort zone can thwart sleep. There is a circadian rhythm in core body temperature (CT), and sleep propensity is highest as CT decreases. Sleep per se further reduces CT. 95 During the sleep period, increased melatonin synthesis, reduced skin sympathetic neuron activity, and behaviours that insulate the body and create a warm microclimate increase the flow of warm blood to peripheral body parts that are rich with arteriovenous anastomoses, such as the hands and the feet. This aids heat loss from the core and results in a CT rhythm that is anti-phasic to the skin temperature (ST) rhythm. Interestingly, coupling between ST and CT is so close that a rapid increase in finger skin temperature predicts subsequent sleep onset,96 so peripheral skin warming could have causal roles in sleep onset. Congruent with this, there are brain regions such as the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus that are important to both thermoregulation and sleep-wake regulation, and mild skin warming promotes sleep-like activity in multiple brain regions.97 Changes in the thermal environment do not affect all sleep stages equally, however. In general, REMS is subject to greater disruption by temperature fluctuation than NREMS due to lower sweat rates at high AT immediately prior to 98 and during REMS than during NREMS linked to your eyes And the key pathway linking your eyes to your central clock is via a specialized type of cell in the eye called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. These cells will strongly affect many of the so called non visual responses to light. It's the cells that are important to rapidly reducing melatonin production to shifting the time of your body's clock. They also influence brain regions that are involved in things like mood and cognition. But for the purpose of today, there are a couple of things to consider. And one of them is that these cells respond differently to different wavelengths of light. As humans, we can see wavelengths between three hundred and eighty and seven hundred and eighty nanometers. Light in the lowest end of this range looks pilots. Light in the highest end of this range red. Other wavelengths outside of this range do affect us, for example, UV light, which is shorter than the lowest of those wavelength is best known for causing skin damage, whereas infrared light, which is above the longest end of the range. Can be used therapeutically as in photo bio modulation. A key idea is that your body's absorption of live depends on protopigments in matter. And these intrinsically photosensitive cells contain a photopigment named melanopsin and that maximally absorbs photons with wavelengths of about four hundred and eighty nanometers, which graphy corresponds to the color of the sky on a clear sunny days, and sure there's no coincidence. They are affected by other wavelengths too, and that matters if the light is bright enough, but it's this type of short wavelength light that is most significant for these cells. These cells are also concentrated in the lower part of the retina, and so they tend to absorb light from the upper visual field, which makes sense given where the sun is as we walk around each day. And I'll add the rod cells, which are key to seeing in darkness, in cone cells, which are key to color vision, do influence these intrinsically sensitive retinal ganglion cells too, and the central clock. Only a bit, and for today, I don't think we need to worry about that. So these intrinsically sensitive cells project directly to the central clock. They also project directly and indirectly to other parts of the brain that revolve in things like sleep break regulation. But the central clock then sends information about light exposure back to the pineal gland, which synthesizes melatonin at appropriate times a day to signal the biological night time throughout cells in the rest of the body. So circulating melatonin in the blood then acts on two different types of receptors at cells throughout the rest of your body to signal the biological nighttime and tell cells to engage in appropriate activities for that time of day, so in that way, you can think of melatonin as being kind of internal time cue. And that makes sense when you consider that many of the cells deep within you aren't really exposed to much light each day, so we really need that endogenous side gaba, if you will. The master clock also relays information about time if they took clocks elsewhere in the body through some other means. Those include things like projections to other parts of the brain. The master clock actually produces some of its own secretions too that can influence the timing of other and it's key to the regulation at your daily call body temperature rhythm, which might have some effects on some of these peripheral clocks. And rhythms in hormones such as cortisol, which can also help synchronize some of those clocks elsewhere. So given the importance of these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells to central clock timing and many of the other non visual effects of light, too, such as affecting alertness and cognition and mood, plus the fact that the melanopsin in these cells responds most strongly to sure wavelengths lie, there's actually a newly developed Debra: Yeah. I mean, I think the step back here is that do we want to shift shift workers or not? You know, that that is the first sort of 101 on shift work. And and and to answer that, you have to know what shift schedule the people are doing in the shift workers. So you go to a factory in that and and you wanna know what shifts they're doing. So If you're only doing 1 night of night shift or 2 nights of night shift, you don't wanna shift their clocks because if you shift them, if you could shift them quickly, Then they're gonna have to shift back when they do day work. So all all you're trying to do on a 1 night and a a a 2 night night shift Is is to try and maintain their lives without too much disruption. This is why we talked about the food thing. And this is how we why we designed that melatonin study with Eleni Marquez. We gave the melatonin in the non shift nights to try and reinforce that message of this is normality, you know, and strengthen that that message. But let's say we're talking about oil rig workers and we know they're on a 3 week of NYCHA. Now in that situation, it might be beneficial to shift them more quickly to that 3 weeks so they Don't have 6 or 7 days of, you know, jet lag, so to speak, we can if if we need to if we need to Sharpen that up. Yes. We could use light. Yes. We could use melatonin. Yes. For, Peripheral clocks, we could use food. And, yes, there have been a few, 2 now. Sean Youngstead's group in, San Diego published phase response codes to exercise. So it seems that exercise or can delay the clock, they're fulfilling the criteria of being a true side gaper. So I think, you know, when we know more about that, you know, there's some slight it was great study. It's nearly a 100 people he studied, young people, old people. Take my hat off to to him and his team. So when I say, you know, it's just that he he, his phase marker Was urine, it's hard to know where the peak of melatonin is in urine. There's just some little things that aren't perfectly clear yet. But if we do more work and people do more studies on this, I think exercise can be brought in along with food, along with caffeine, along with light, along with melatonin, as possible ways of shifting the clock when you want To shift them. But that's not for every shift worker. Greg: And if we assume that the data in his study hold up, like you said, he was looking at 6 sulfur toxic melatonin, which is the main metabolite of melatonin in the urine as opposed to looking at levels of melatonin in the blood, which would be preferable, Ben, the phase response curve that he plotted for activity is quite similar to that for light. So activity in the morning tends to shift people earlier, and activity late at night tends to shift people later. But you mentioned whether we wanna shift people, and we've also touched on the idea of personalizing people's shift schedules in our conversation so far. I think there are things that we can probably say about what tend to work well for most people with respect to their shifts. For example, in general, forward rotating schedules, so moving from mornings to evenings to night, seem to be less strenuous than backward rotating ones that go in an anticlockwise direction, in general, the longer people's shifts are, the more rest they need afterwards.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Regulates Sleep-Wake Cycles**: Melatonin is often referred to as the \"sleep hormone\" because of its role in the sleep-wake cycle. It is secreted in response to darkness and signals the body that it is time to prepare for sleep. Melatonin levels rise in the evening, remain high during the night, and drop in the early morning, which helps to promote a healthy sleep pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Synchronizes Circadian Rhythms**: Beyond just sleep induction, melatonin helps to synchronize the body's circadian rhythms with the external environment. This includes adjusting the body's internal clock in response to changes in light exposure, such as those experienced during travel across time zones (jet lag) or shift work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Antioxidant Properties**: Melatonin also functions as an antioxidant, which means it can neutralize harmful free radicals and reduce oxidative stress within the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Immune System Support**: Some research suggests that melatonin may have immunomodulatory effects, potentially enhancing the immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Regulation of Seasonal Reproduction**: In some animals, melatonin is involved in the regulation of seasonal reproductive cycles, responding to changes in day length.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of melatonin supplements can be beneficial for certain individuals, such as those with disrupted circadian rhythms due to jet lag, shift work, or certain sleep disorders. However, the quality and purity of melatonin supplements can vary, and it is important to use pharmaceutical-grade preparations, especially for long-term use, to ensure consistent dosing and avoid potential contaminants. Melatonin is generally considered safe and non-addictive, but more research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects, particularly in specific populations such as children.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mMelatonin is like the body's own version of a bedtime story, signaling that it's time to wind down and drift off to dreamland. It helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle, acting as an internal clock that tells your body when it's time to feel sleepy and when it's time to be alert.\n",
      "\n",
      "As darkness falls, your melatonin levels rise, gently nudging you towards sleep, much like a cozy blanket inviting you to snuggle in. During the night, it works to maintain your slumber, helping you stay asleep until the sun peeks through your curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to its role in sleep, melatonin has a few other tricks up its sleeve. It's a bit of an antioxidant superhero, fighting off pesky free radicals and supporting your immune system, much like a cup of tea with a dash of honey when you're feeling under the weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, melatonin is not just about getting you to the land of nod; it's also about keeping you healthy and ticking along nicely. If you're considering supplementing with melatonin, it's wise to have a chat with a healthcare professional to ensure it's the right choice for you. They'll help you navigate the dos and don'ts, ensuring you don't end up like a character in a British farce, taking something that doesn't quite suit your scene.\u001b[0m\n",

       "For shift workers, especially those working overnight or rotating shifts, maintaining health and well-being can be challenging due to disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Here are some definitive recommendations to help manage these challenges:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Optimize Sleep Environment**:\n",
       "   - Ensure your bedroom is dark during your sleep time. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask.\n",
       "   - Keep the bedroom quiet with earplugs or white noise machines.\n",
       "   - Maintain a cool bedroom temperature, using fans or a suitable mattress that doesn't retain heat.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Manage Light Exposure**:\n",
       "   - Avoid bright light before trying to sleep. Dim the lights or wear sunglasses if necessary.\n",
       "   - Get exposure to bright light during your \"waking\" hours to help align your circadian rhythm with your work schedule.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Melatonin Supplementation**:\n",
       "   - Consider taking melatonin after a night shift to promote sleep, as it can help shift your circadian rhythm. However, be cautious with dosage and timing, and consult with a healthcare provider if needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Caffeine and Meal Timing**:\n",
       "   - Avoid consuming caffeine and large meals close to your intended sleep time.\n",
       "   - Try to maintain a consistent eating schedule, even on days off, to help regulate your body clock.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Napping Strategies**:\n",
       "   - If necessary, take short naps before starting a night shift to reduce sleepiness during work.\n",
       "   - Be cautious with napping too close to your \"nighttime\" sleep, as it can make it harder to fall asleep later.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Shift Schedule Considerations**:\n",
       "   - If possible, work in forward-rotating shifts (morning to evening to night) rather than backward-rotating shifts.\n",
       "   - Advocate for shift schedules that allow for adequate rest between shifts, especially after longer shifts.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Physical Activity**:\n",
       "   - Regular exercise can help improve sleep quality and overall health, but avoid vigorous activity close to your sleep time.\n",
       "   - Time exercise appropriately if you're trying to shift your circadian rhythm (e.g., exercise in the morning to advance your clock or in the evening to delay it).\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Social and Family Life**:\n",
       "   - Communicate with family and friends about your schedule to help maintain social connections and support.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Workplace Interventions**:\n",
       "   - Employers should consider optimizing lighting in the workplace to help workers stay alert during night shifts without affecting their ability to sleep afterward.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Health Monitoring**:\n",
       "    - Regularly monitor your health, including mental health, as shift work can increase the risk of certain conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, these recommendations are general and may not apply to every individual's situation. Personalizing strategies based on one's specific work schedule, chronotype, and lifestyle is crucial for the best outcomes."

       "\n",
       "1. Timing: Tipton suggests that it might be beneficial to have been up and active for a couple of hours before immersing oneself in cold water. This is to avoid the potential cardiac problems that can occur early in the morning when the body is just waking up.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Medical Check: He strongly advises that everyone should ensure they are fit and healthy enough to undertake cold water immersion. This includes having a proper medical check-up. However, he warns that even a thorough medical check cannot identify all potential conditions that could lead to serious outcomes when immersing in cold water.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Information and Education: Tipton encourages individuals to educate themselves about the potential risks and benefits of cold water immersion. This includes being discerning about where they get their information from, and ensuring it comes from credible and knowledgeable sources.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Incremental Approach: Tipton recommends starting slowly and gradually increasing the duration and intensity of cold water immersion. This allows the body to adapt and reduces the risk of adverse effects.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Safety Measures: He advises swimming with a group, preferably in a lifeguarded area, and always entering the water slowly to minimize the cold shock response. He also suggests limiting exposure to 10 minutes and not relying on how one feels to determine when to get out of the water.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Health Check: Tipton warns against cold water immersion for individuals with certain health conditions, such as a family history of sudden or unexplained cardiac death, hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, long QT syndrome, peripheral vascular disorders, history of seizures, and a family history of aneurysms.\n",
       "\n",

       "- It is recommended to allow at least one hour before bed per unit of alcohol consumed, plus one additional hour. For example, if you consume a pint of beer (typically about two units), you should finish drinking at least three hours before bed. This is due to the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol.\n",

       "1. Acute Insomnia: Also known as adjustment insomnia, this type of insomnia is short-term and can be triggered by various factors. These factors can include external stimuli such as jet lag and certain medications, or internal stimuli like psychological distress, anticipation of important events, or spikes in pain. Acute insomnia generally resolves once the disruptive stimuli subside.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Chronic Insomnia: Chronic insomnia is a long-term sleep disorder and can be caused by various factors. These include:\n",
       "   - Other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea\n",
       "   - Psychiatric disorders including depression\n",
       "   - Consumption of certain medications including some antidepressants\n",
       "   - Drug and alcohol abuse\n",
       "   - Medical disorders such as arthritis, asthma, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, kidney disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, prostate hypertrophy, and rhinitis\n",
       "   - Poor sleep hygiene\n",
       "\n",
       "Chronic insomnia can have significant implications for a person's quality of life, and managing it often requires addressing the underlying causes. Diagnosing insomnia typically involves carrying out a detailed medical, sleep, and sleepiness history by a qualified sleep medicine specialist. If you suspect you have a sleep disorder, it's advisable to consult with a sleep specialist.\n",
       "   \n",
       "In addition to these major types, insomnia can also be classified based on its characteristics into sleep-onset insomnia (difficulty falling asleep) and sleep-maintenance insomnia (difficulty staying asleep)."

Many elite athletes take a long time to fall asleep, experience frequent awakenings during the night, and report daytime fatigue. A third to a half of these athletes have poor quality sleep despite being meticulous about sleep hygiene.\n",

       "1. **Morning**: Start the day with a consistent wake-up time, allowing the body's biological clock to reset. Spend at least an hour outdoors in daylight each day to give your body's central clock a strong time cue. This could be combined with some form of light physical activity to kickstart the day, as even low-intensity activity can support many aspects of health and function.\n",

       "\n",
       "3. **Evening**: Minimize exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed, aiding the body's transition into its sleep cycle. Implement an eating window of eight to ten hours, ending at least two hours before bed. This contributes to time-restricted eating and can improve many aspects of health.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Throughout the day**: Focus on maintaining a nutritious diet, emphasizing foods high in satiety per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and fish. Avoid unnecessary snacking, particularly of low-quality foods. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Once or Twice a Week**: Monitor body weight to maintain a healthy range. This should be done at a consistent time, either before eating or drinking anything, and preferably wearing the same item of clothing or none at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Rest Day**: Incorporate a rest day into the week's routine, following the concept of the biblical training week. This day of rest can provide a necessary pause from strenuous activity.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Circadian Rhythm Disruption**: Our bodies have an internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. Exposure to light, especially blue light, can interfere with this rhythm by suppressing the production of melatonin, a hormone that signals to our body that it's time to sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep and lead to disrupted sleep patterns.\n",

       "3. **Health Implications**: Chronic disruption of the circadian rhythm and poor sleep quality have been linked to a variety of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, depression, and even certain types of cancer.\n",

       "To mitigate these effects, it's recommended to limit exposure to screens for at least an hour before bed. If this isn't possible, consider using a blue light filter on your devices or wearing blue light blocking glasses. Also, try to make your sleeping environment as dark as possible, using blackout curtains or an eye mask if necessary."

The therapy aims to break the association between bed and wakefulness, which is often reinforced in individuals with insomnia.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process works by restricting the time spent in bed to the actual sleep duration. For example, if an individual spends ten hours in bed but only sleeps for six hours, they would restrict their time in bed to around six and a half hours (adding thirty minutes as no one falls asleep the moment they lie down). This is achieved by delaying bedtime but waking at the usual morning time, thereby reducing the amount of time spent awake in bed. \n",
       "\n",
       "During the initial stages, bedtime restriction therapy can be challenging as it may lead to fatigue during the day due to reduced sleep. However, in the long run, it improves sleep quality by consolidating sleep into a shorter, more efficient period.\n",

At first, she felt more tired than usual, but quickly her sleep efficiency improved dramatically. As her sleep efficiency stayed above 85% for a week, she advanced her bedtime by 15 minutes. This process was repeated until she achieved her required sleep duration."
