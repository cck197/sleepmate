       "Brilliant! So, the SEEDS exercise is all about the five pillars of good health: Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management. Yes, I know, \"SEEDS\" is as cheesy as a cheddar factory, but bear with me. The idea is to plant small SEEDS (i.e., behaviours that are good for you) and water them every day so they can take root (i.e., become habits that you don't have to constantly think about). \n",
       "\n",
       "Now, we're not talking about grand, sweeping changes here. No, we're focusing on tiny, manageable behaviours that contribute to good outcomes. For each pillar, you'll think of a small thing you can do to contribute to it. The goal is to come up with three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 teeny-weeny daily habits. \n",
       "\n",
       "Once you've got your SEEDS, you'll try to do them each day, and we'll keep track of your progress. It's a bit like a game, but the prize is better health and wellbeing. \n",
