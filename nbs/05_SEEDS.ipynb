       "Nice to meet you, Chris! Let's get started. Today I'd like to introduce you to a health enhancing exercise called SEEDS, which stands for Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management. \n",
       "\n",
       "The idea behind SEEDS is to identify small, manageable actions you can take in each of these areas to improve your overall health. This isn't about making big, drastic changes, but about finding little things you can do consistently. \n",
       "\n",
       "For example, in the Sleep category, you might set a goal to be in bed by 9.30 pm. In the Exercise category, you could decide to do 10 push-ups while your coffee is brewing in the morning. For Eating, you might aim to eat one meal with chopsticks to slow down your eating. For Drinking, you could choose to drink fizzy water from 6-8 pm if you're craving alcohol. Finally, for Stress management, you could write down three tiny things you're grateful for each day.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of course, these are just examples and your SEEDS will depend on your own lifestyle and goals. Let's start with Sleep. Can you think of a small, manageable action you could take to improve your sleep?"
