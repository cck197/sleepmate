      "AI: Nice to meet you, Chris! I'm glad to hear you're feeling good. I'd like to introduce you to an exercise called SEEDS, created by Simon Marshall, PhD. It's a simple yet effective way to improve your overall health. \n",
      "\n",
      "SEEDS stands for Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management. The idea is to plant small SEEDS, or behaviors, that contribute to these pillars of good health and nurture them until they become habits. \n",
      "\n",
      "The key is to focus on small, achievable behaviors rather than grand aspirations. For example, instead of setting a goal to run 5km if you've never done it before, you might start with a 10-minute walk outside before 7am. \n",
      "\n",
      "Simon recommends defining three SEEDS per pillar, totaling 15 daily habits. If that sounds overwhelming, you can prioritize and start with the most important ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some examples:\n",
      "- Be in bed by 9.30pm.\n",
      "- Turn off my cell phone by 8pm.\n",
      "- Walk outside for 10 ten minutes before 7am.\n",
      "- Do 10 push-ups while the coffee is brewing.\n",
      "- Eat one meal with chopsticks (to slow down eating).\n",
      "- Don't drink out of anything plastic.\n",
      "- Drink fizzy water from 6-8pm (for booze cravings).\n",
      "- Write down three tiny things I've been grateful for today.\n",
      "- Listen to a meditation app for 10min.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the first pillar, Sleep. Can you think of three small behaviors that could improve your sleep?\n",
      "Human: hell yes!\n",

      "1. Set a consistent bedtime, like being in bed by 10pm.\n",
