       "Brilliant! The SEEDS exercise is all about the pillars of good health: Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management. Yes, \"SEEDS\" is a bit cheesy, but the metaphor of planting small SEEDS (i.e., behaviors that are good for you) and watering them every day so they can take root (i.e., become habits that you don't have to constantly think about) is consistent with the science of behavior change and habit formation. \n",
       "\n",
       "For each of these pillars, you'll think of a tiny thing that you can do to contribute to it. We're not talking grandiose, aspirational intentions here, but rather small, achievable behaviors. The idea is that focusing on these small behaviors builds the correct mindset and contributes to knock-on effects on other changes in that pillar. \n",
       "\n",
       "Simon recommends using three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 daily habits. If that sounds like a lot, don't worry, you can prioritize them. The top line is what you'll start with. Once you've done these consistently, you can add the second line, and so on. \n",
       "\n",
