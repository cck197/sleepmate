    "\n",
    "In this episode, we're diving into the world of sleep tracking through wearables and nearables. We'll explore what these devices are and what they can, and importantly, cannot do for you. Many of us have experienced the confusion of a sleep tracker indicating poor sleep quality, when in fact, we felt quite rested. We'll delve into why this discrepancy occurs, discussing the limitations and intricacies of these technologies. Conversely, we'll also address the opposite scenario: why your tracker might suggest you've had a good night's sleep when you've actually spent the night tossing and turning. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of these devices is crucial in using them effectively to enhance your sleep and, consequently, your athletic performance. Join us as we unravel the mysteries behind sleep tracking technology and how you can best utilize it in conjunction with SleepMate to achieve optimal sleep health."

    "Why bother with sleep tracking at all? This question brings to mind a valuable insight from my friend and colleague, Simon Marshall, who is an expert in behavior science. Simon once pointed out to me that self-monitoring is the cornerstone of behavior change. This principle is especially true in the realm of sleep and athletic performance. By tracking our sleep patterns, we gain valuable insights into our sleep habits, which can often be the first step towards meaningful improvement. It's not just about the data; it's about understanding and acting upon that data to make positive changes in our lives. Whether it's adjusting bedtime routines, modifying the sleep environment, or identifying and addressing potential sleep disorders, self-monitoring through these devices can be a powerful tool."

    "One aspect of these devices that I particularly appreciate is their ability to track individual responses. This personalized approach is a significant advantage over trying to infer what might work based on the results of a randomized control trial. In such trials, the study population and environment often don't match our own unique circumstances. Each individual’s sleep pattern and requirements are unique, influenced by a myriad of factors like lifestyle, stress levels, physical activity, and even genetic predispositions. These devices provide data that reflect our personal sleep experiences, allowing for a more tailored and effective approach to improving sleep quality. This individualized data is crucial for understanding how different interventions or changes affect our sleep, enabling us to make more informed decisions about our sleep health and athletic performance."

    "Another valuable lesson I learned from Simon is the importance of focusing on process over outcome. It's more crucial to track the behaviors that lead to the desired outcome rather than the outcome itself. This approach shifts our focus from the end result to the actions that contribute to that result. For instance, if improving sleep efficiency is our goal, rather than myopically focusing on the outcome - such as a percentage of sleep efficiency - it's more beneficial to track the behaviors that lead to improved sleep. This could mean monitoring the bedtime routines or environmental factors that contribute to better sleep. By tracking and adjusting these behaviors, we're more likely to influence the desired outcome positively. This approach not only fosters a deeper understanding of what affects our sleep but also empowers us to make practical, sustainable changes to enhance sleep quality and, by extension, athletic performance."

    "Indeed, the appeal of a wearable sleep tracking device lies in its ability to passively monitor objective sleep metrics, alleviating the need for the manual effort involved in keeping a sleep diary. These devices work in the background, tracking various aspects of sleep such as duration, phases (like REM and deep sleep), and disturbances throughout the night. This passive monitoring provides valuable data without any active input or time commitment from the user, making it a convenient and efficient way to gather sleep data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the objective nature of the data collected by wearables offers a clear, quantifiable perspective on sleep patterns. While sleep diaries rely on subjective perception and recall of sleep quality, wearables provide a more consistent and unbiased record. This objective data can be especially helpful in identifying trends and patterns that might not be obvious through subjective reporting alone. Wearables, therefore, serve as a powerful tool in the arsenal for improving sleep health, complementing the insights gained from sleep diaries and other subjective methods."

You make very sparing use of British humour and the occasional self-deprecating joke. Your clients are experts in AI and ethics, so they already know you're a language model and your capabilities and limitations, so don't remind them of that. They're under medical supervision and familiar with ethical issues in general so you don't need to remind them about those either. Your goal is to help the human understand the difference between self-reported and sensor-based methods of sleep tracking, also known as sleep-state misperception or paradoxical insomnia: You may notice differences between your sleep diary and sleep tracking wearable device, which is completely normal. All of us, whether 'good' or 'poor' sleepers, can overestimate or underestimate our sleep. This is because sleep is not an on-or-off switch, but rather a time when our brain continues to process internal and external information. When we overestimate how long we are awake during the night, and underestimate the time we have spent sleeping, we can start to become concerned. Doubts and worries about sleep can make it even harder to sleep. Hopefully this information can help your sleep data into perspective. - Time Spent Sleeping It's important to remember that the amount of sleep we get naturally changes from night to night. Additionally, there is not a magical number that tells us exactly how much sleep we need. The best way to tell whether you have had enough sleep, is to see how you feel during the day. If you can do most things you would like to do, without dosing off when you do not wish to, there is a good chance that you have had enough sleep. If you are sleeping shorter on some nights, keep in mind that on subsequent night(s) your brain will naturally sleep deeper, but not necessarily longer. - Sleep Efficiency Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time you spend asleep compared to the time you spend in bed. Sleep efficiency is a better aspect to focus on rather than the total sleep time, as the quality of our sleep is often more important than the quantity. - Time Taken to Fall Asleep Time taken to fall asleep is the time it takes you to fall asleep each night. This is also called sleep onset latency. It is important to keep in mind that sleep is not an on-or-off state but rather has several different stages. When you are drifting into sleep, some parts of your brain may still be aware of the surroundings. This means that sometimes we may have fallen asleep even though it feels like we are awake, which is normal. A helpful tip: when you attempt to sleep, focus on resting and relaxing your body, rather than pondering when sleep may come. Sleep naturally happens when our body and mind is relaxed. The Open Focus exercise is particular helpful here. Night-time Awakening Night-time awakening is the amount of time you spend awake during the night. This is also called wake after sleep onset. It's important to remember that awakenings are a natural part of everyone's sleep. We all go through several sleep cycles per night. After each sleep cycle, we naturally wake up briefly, before drifting into the next cycle. It is normal for us to wake up a few times per night. Some of these awakenings are brief, and we may not remember them at all in the morning. We may remember other awakenings if they last a little longer. Night-time awakenings are only a problem if we have trouble getting back to sleep. A helpful tip: when you wake up in the middle of the night, tell yourself that this is normal, as you are probably in between two sleep cycles. Let your mind and body keep drifting towards the next sleep cycle. You are more likely to drift back to sleep quickly when you feel calm and relaxed during these normal part of awakenings. \n",

Use bullet and numbered lists where appropriate. Be definitive with your response. Don't say anything that's not mentioned explicitly your knowledge. If you can't answer the question using the text, say \"Sorry I'm not sure.\" and nothing else. The human is an expert in nutrition so you don't need to tell them to see a registered dietitian. Your knowledge: When you wake From sleep, you should feel like your sleep was satisfying and restorative. Then over the course of your waking day, should have relatively high function. I say relatively because you shouldn't compare yourself to the smartest person in the world necessarily, but instead to your personal norms. And when referring to function, what I mean are things such as your cognition, so how well you pay attention during tasks, Your ability to remember things. Can you remember where you put your keys? Do you find yourself looking for glasses when they're sat on the bridge of your nose? Your mood, And then also how well you interact with other people. It's perfectly normal to have some fluctuations in your daytime function. Lots of us, for instance, have a dip in various brain functions around the middle of the waking day, typically at about 2 or 3 PM for people with relatively normal sleep timing. Next, in the evening, you should feel your sleep be at roughly the same time each day. And then when you go to bed, you should fall asleep relatively quickly and wake infrequently and only for brief periods. And in later episodes, I'll put some numbers to what I just said. Finally, there would ideally be no unusual behaviors during sleep, such as acting out your dreams or eating. And later, we'll get to some sleep disorders where these types of unusual events take place. My thinking about sleep health has been shaped strongly by a brilliant psychiatrist named Daniel Beissie, who's at the University of Pittsburgh and is The man behind many different assessment tools that are used in sleep medicine, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. He published an influential paper that I'll link to. It proposed a way of conceptualizing sleep health that I think is very helpful. Initially, he came up with an acronym For the dimensions of sleep health that he proposed, the acronym is SATED. Those letters stand for satisfaction. Are you satisfied with the sleep that you just had? Alertness. Do you feel drowsy while you're awake? Timing, when do you go to bed And wake up, and what is the midpoint of that efficiency, which is the proportion of time you're in bed that you're actually asleep. So if you're in bed for 10 hours and you got 7 hours of sleep during that period, your sleep would be 70% sufficient. And then duration. Last night, you might have slept 7 hours, for instance, the night before, 8 hours. The acronym has Since been revised to r u sated with the r and the u standing for regularity. He chose these dimensions for various reasons. One of which is that each can be quantified. Another is that each has independently been associated with various different chronic diseases in prospective studies where people are followed over time. And each has been associated with all cause mortality, which is deaths from all causes combined, so deaths regardless of what the inciting event was. There are some other reasons we should Think about sleep as comprising several dimensions. One idea that I think is worth considering is that these dimensions interact with each other. Let's take the example of sleep restriction studies, where people are allowed some time in bed each 24 hours, but less time in bed, then they need to get a full complement of sleep. If, for instance, you're normally in bed from 10 PM until 6 AM, you have an 8 hour sleep opportunity. Amy seemingly always feels sleepy during the day. She is generally meticulous about practising good sleep hygiene, but she just can’t stop waking up for extended periods at night. She begins tracking her sleep. She learns that, on average, she’s in bed from 10 PM to 8 AM each night - a 10-hour sleep opportunity. But she’s only asleep for 6 of those hours in total, so her sleep efficiency is 60 % (6 / 10 X 100). Under supervision, Amy begins bedtime restriction therapy. This involves delaying her bedtime (which helps build extra pressure to sleep) such that she only spends 6 hours (her average sleep duration) in total in bed each night. So, her new sleep opportunity is from 2 AM to 8 AM, and she meticulously goes to bed and gets up at precisely the same times throughout this intervention. At first, this is rough. She’s even more tired than normal. But very quickly her sleep efficiency improves dramatically. When her average sleep efficiency is above 85 % (which is generally considered healthy) for a week, she advances her bedtime by 15 minutes. Her sleep opportunity is now 6 hours and 15 minutes. This process then repeats itself - if her sleep efficiency at the new sleep opportunity is above 85 % for a week, she adds 15 minutes to her sleep opportunity. Once she is spending as much time asleep as she needs, she retains her new bedtimes. Three months later, she settles on going to bed at 11:30 PM, waking up at 8 AM, and her sleep is 88 % efficient. She feels like a new person. So, what can we all learn from this? ● If you’re struggling to sleep through the night, enforcing regular bedtimes is critical. If your sleep is poor, don’t start going to bed earlier and earlier. Set an alarm for 1 hour before bedtime to ingrain your bedtimes. ● It is sometimes smart to wake to an alarm. Please note that I am categorically not advocating alarm clock use if your sleep is healthy though! How to sleep through the night: a summary of key concepts That’s all for now. If you’re struggling to sleep through the night, in addition to applying basic principles of good sleep hygiene during the daytime, minimise napping, use the 20-minute rule, and be meticulous about bedtime regularity! Do these things and you’ll reap the rewards of more restorative sleep. The final idea that I wanna leave you with today is this. When you can't control your sleep schedule, other lifestyle factors can help prop up your health and performance. A helpful analogy is that you can think of your health and performance as being a bit like stalls, each of which is supported by many legs. And those legs include circadian rhythms and sleep, activity, nutrition, social integration, and some other variables too. If you lose one of those many legs, the stool won't necessarily collapse. Poor sleep isn't some sort of sentence, And you therefore shouldn't put pressure on yourself to sleep. Sleep's not something that you can force, and, ironically, when people do try and force their sleep, they often sleep substantially worse. Instead, sleep is something that just happens when conditions allow. And when conditions don't allow sleep, there are lots of things that you can do to still function well, and I'll get to this in more detail in a later episode. I'll back up that claim with a few examples, And let's start with some observations of pre industrial people. Taking the example of the Hadza, A very well studied group of hunter gatherers who live in Northern Tanzania. Hunter gatherers are renowned for their exemplary health, And the hads were no exception to this. You might therefore expect that their sleep health is exemplary. It isn't, by any means, Based on the research that has been done so far, I'll give 2 examples of this. The first being a study that was published by Gandhi Yatish and his colleagues. Paper came out in 2015 and was very widely discussed. And in that paper, they looked at 3 groups of pre industrial people, including the Hadza. They found that the Hadza got 6 hours and 18 minutes of sleep per night on average, which is well below what most would consider optimal for young adults. Bear in mind that the average age of the hands of people in this study was 37. And their sleep wasn't that efficient either at 83%. The study was very interesting, and it does have some limitations like all studies do. But similar findings have been reported by other groups of scientists, and some of the other research suggests that the sleep quality might be really quite poor. I'll reinforce what I just said by giving another example, a study that I particularly liked That was done by David Sampson and his colleagues and was published more recently. In this work, they found that in a larger group of Hadza, Average sleep was 6 hours and 24 minutes each night, so very similar to the first study that I mentioned. However, Their wake after sleep onset was 2 hours and 26 minutes, so their sleep was impressively inefficient at 68%, which is very, very low. That's comparable to many adults who have neurodegenerative diseases, for instance. So In the case of groups such as the Hadza, their health might be exemplary in spite of their sleep, not because of it. And that might be because many of the other aspects of their lifestyles are so conducive to good health and their resilience. And then there are some experimental studies that show that when people aren't sleeping well, other aspects of lifestyle can help support the health and their function. 2 studies that I really liked were published by Nicholas Cena and David Bishop. In the first of these studies that's published a couple of years ago, they had 24 healthy young men, and they split them into 3 groups. 1 of the groups was normal sleep. So for 5 nights, they had 8 hours in bed each night. Another group was sleep restriction. So these people only had 4 hours in bed per night for the 5 nights, and that was enforced by having them go to bed 4 hours later than normal, so they got out of bed at the same time as they normally would. In a study such as this, you might only be Allowed to go to bed at midnight, so 2 hours later than normal, and to get out of bed at 4 AM, so 2 hours earlier than normal, So you have a 4 hour sleep opportunity. Lots of these studies are done for several consecutive nights. And when we look at these types of studies, because they enforce very strict bedtimes, While they might be impairing one dimension of sleep health, sleep duration, they might actually be concurrently improving several others, Including the regularity of sleep and sleep efficiency too. Another point that's worth making is that Many of us have multiple issues with our sleep. For a lot of people, those issues are below the thresholds that are used to diagnose sleep disorders. Examples of these types of sub threshold sleep problems include lifestyle driven insufficient sleep. So maybe, for instance, you need 8 hours in bed to get enough sleep. But because you're working hard and you're finishing work late and you wake to an alarm in the morning, You're only currently getting 7 hours in bed, so you have lifestyle driven insufficient sleep, which over time is going to catch up with you in some ways. But maybe alongside that, you also snore. The snoring isn't so severe that it would meet the threshold for something such as sleep apnea, but that's not to say that it won't affect your biology in many ways. There are also some frank sleep disorders, each with specific diagnostic criteria. We'll get into these another time, but there are seven broad categories of these. 1 is possibly the most common, which is insomnia, and there are some subtypes of insomnia. Another category is the sleep related breathing disorders. Among these are primary snoring and also various forms of Sleep apnea, the most common form of sleep apnea, is due to obstruction of the upper airway. Then there are circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders, and these are broadly split into 2 categories. 1 being extrinsic, such as jet lag and shift work disorder. And these extrinsic disorders aren't due to any sort of inherent dysfunction within somebody's body's clockwork, but are instead the result of misalignment between their sleep schedules and when their bodies crave sleep and so on. Then there are intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders. And there are a few of these. An example is delayed sleep phase. This is when people of a given age and biological sex have very late sleep relative to their peers, and that is the result of the fact that their body's clock is set very late. Then there's the category of parasomnias. And there are many parasomnias, all typified by the fact that there are unusual behaviors that take place during sleep. Some of these take place primarily during REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep, which is the stage of sleep in which you have your most vivid and bizarre dreams. An example of these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is a disorder in which, Because of dysfunction within the central nervous system, people act out their dreams, which is itself sometimes very dangerous. But for other reasons, REM sleep behavior disorder is particularly dangerous, putting people at massively increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson's disease. And then among the non REM or the n REM parasomnias, There's sleepwalking, which often takes place during the deepest stage of sleep and is sometimes benign, but Might also result in some modest daytime impairment in some people. Then there are sleep related movement disorders. Of the most common these is restless leg syndrome, which we'll return to later. Sleep-maintenance insomnia: how to sleep through the night In the previous blog, we briefly reviewed what insomnia is, as well as a few simple strategies you can immediately put to use to sleep better. In this blog we’re going to focus on how to sleep through the night. In doing so, I’ll discuss a few things we can all learn from the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, a disorder in which people wake frequently and for prolonged periods when they would rather be sleeping. So, if you’re tired of waking up at night, try these tips and let me know the results! Your daytime activities strongly influence your night-time sleep In a previous blog, Megan shared loads of tips about sleep hygiene. Here are some numeric guidelines for several particularly important sleep hygiene components: ● Get plenty of exposure to daylight: Aim to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors in daylight each day, preferably in the first half of your waking day. Why not take an early lunch break outdoors with others? ● Limit your consumption of stimulants such as caffeine: Cap your intake at 2 mg caffeine per kg body mass per day (use this site to estimate your intake), finishing your last caffeine-containing item by at least 9 hours before bedtime. Swap your caffeinated drinks for caffeine-free herbal teas. ● Whenever possible, avoid high-intensity exercise shortly before bedtime: finish vigorous-intensity and/or high workload physical activity by at least 4 hours before bedtime, finish moderate-intensity physical activity at least 2 hours before bedtime. Don’t worry, sex doesn’t count and often helps people sleep… so get busy. ● Finish consuming all calorie-containing items at least 2 hours before bedtime. Stop consuming fluids at this time too if you’re prone to needing to pee during the sleep period. Notice that these guidelines are all relative to your sleep timing, not time of day. There are very (very!) large differences between people in how their sleep is affected by these stimuli, but try these guidelines to begin. Welcome back to Reason Well-being. I'm your host, Greg Potter. In years gone by, many of us viewed sleep as an inconvenience, something that we can trade in exchange for more hours to enjoy and benefit from waking life. You probably heard would say something to the effect of, I'll sleep, but I'm dead, advertising their sleep loss with a badge of honor. Sleep's been the neglected lifestyle stepchild, While physical activity and nutrition have been showered with praise and adoration, this is still evident in many ways. A recent analysis This found that of 194 World Health Organization member states, only 22% had collected and published data on the deterioration of the populations. Fortunately, the tides have been turning. Waves of science are showing the importance of sleep for all bodily systems, and most of us have woken up just how critical it is. We shouldn't see sleep as a cost. How much can we afford at the end of the day when we spent our time on More important matters like working hard, making money, seeing friends, and binge watching Netflix. Instead, we should see it as an investment in tomorrow, for By regularly getting enough well timed, high quality sleep, we'll be the best versions of ourselves. For the last 13 years, I've been fascinated by sleep. This has taken me on a meandering journey that's included doing a PhD that focused in part on roles of sleep and metabolic health, coaching people to better sleep, I'm working with various sleep related companies to help develop products and services and to deliver educational sessions. I've therefore decided to condense some of my thoughts on what most people need to know about sleep into a series of solo episodes. Today, we're going to explore what sleep health really is. Thinking about it in a comprehensive way that includes several dimensions. We'll also reflect on the fact that your sleep is Jaked by many factors, including social and societal forces. We'll end by considering evidence that poor sleep's not some sort of Even when your sleep is unavoidably disrupted, other behaviors can help you compensate for wonky sleep. In later episodes, we'll get into each of the main dimensions of sleep health, addressing simple things you can do to improve them all. If you haven't already listened to them, The 2 Body Clock episodes from the 1st season should be a helpful primer for these episodes too. I've linked to them in the show notes. Please note that I'm focusing on adult sleep, But most of the same principles apply to younger people. Let's start with what healthy sleep actually is. You might not have ever thought about how to define what healthy sleep is, but this subject matters. If we can come up with some parameters for what constitutes healthy sleep, We'll better know when and how to intervene to improve sleep. Nowadays, lots of people use Wearables, nearables, and airables to track their sleep. And lots of these products give a sleep score out of a100. There are a few issues here, though. One is that not all of these devices have actually been validated, and we don't know how accurate they are. Another is that when they have been validated, most of those studies are done on relatively healthy young people with healthy sleep. And so we know less about how effectively they track sleep in people with, for example, certain sleep disorders. Then there is the fact that the sleep scores that they provide are based on proprietary calculations, And we therefore don't know what these calculations actually mean. And if you've ever used 2 different sleep trackers concurrently, You say you've used a wrist worn sleep tracker and a finger worn sleep tracker at the same time, then you might have found that they gave you quite Different sleep scores. I think there's a better way of thinking about sleep wake health, the way that is accessible to everyone regardless of whether you own one of these devices. To me, a healthy night of sleep is roughly as follows. sleeps to both standardise the sleep environment as much as possible and minimise potential negative influences of novel environments on sleep. Sleep-monitoring devices There has been a substantial and continuous rise in use of sleep-tracking technology in recent years, and the global market for these products is forecast to continue to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% from 2023 to 2028.159 There are many forms of sleep-tracking devices. Most are worn on the wrist, but some are worn on parts of the body including a finger, an ankle, and the head. Sleep-monitoring nearables are not worn but are placed close to the body, such as under the mattress or by the bedside, as in the case of smartphone applications that track sleep. Used appropriately, sleep-monitoring devices can certainly benefit consumers, and several studies have reported that using these devices and their accompanying applications can improve sleep quality in healthy people.160 Sleep trackers might also make users more engaged with their sleep.161 Furthermore, many sleep trackers can monitor other important determinants of health, such as physical activity, pulse rate, pulse rate variability, and oxygen saturation. This self-monitoring can favourably affect health behaviours by increasing their salience — for example, stimulating increases in daily step count 162 — and some wearables have proven helpful in helping to identify diseases such as atrial fibrillation163 and COVID-19,164 though the potential risks of false positives or overtreatment of otherwise asymptomatic conditions require further investigation. Sleep trackers are not a panacea, however, and it is plausible that their utility likely interacts with user characteristics such as perfectionism and anxiety about health. Indeed, some consumers might overinterpret data about health from these devices, perhaps due in part to unawareness of the unknown or limited validity of these devices, particularly in the context of people with sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep-related movement disorders. Indeed, a group of sleep medicine practitioners coined the term “orthosomnia” for people preoccupied with a perfectionistic quest for “ideal” sleep data, documenting a case series of patients experiencing increased anxiety about sleep fuelled in part by sleep tracker data.55 Prior to this, the term “chronorexia” was proposed for essentially the same phenomenon,165 but the term orthosomnia has gained more traction. Since this work, additional research has indicated that monitoring sleep trackers tends to increase sleep-related anxiety as people strive for better sleep,166 which aligns with sleep medicine practitioners’ perceptions of these devices.161 The little research done so far shows that providing negative feedback about sleep results might also impair people’s function during wakefulness. For example, a rigorous study allowed healthy young adults either an 8-h or a 5-h sleep opportunity for 2 consecutive nights.167 After each sleep bout, the researchers told the participants they had either had an 8-h or a 5-h sleep opportunity, respectively, and in keeping with this, they manipulated the speed of a bedside clock so that it either ran on time, fast, or slow. The results revealed that when participants were told they had an 8-h sleep opportunity but had actually had 5 h in bed, reaction times were faster during a psychomotor vigilance test than when they were correctly told they had had 5 h in bed. Interestingly, being told they had 8 h in bed mitigated the higher daytime slow-wave activity evident after insufficient sleep. Similarly, when participants were told they had 5 h in bed but actually had 8 h, reaction times were slower than when they were accurately told they had an 8-h sleep opportunity. Furthermore, when participants were told they had 8 h in bed, whether accurately or not, high-alpha activity, a proxy of the circadian wake drive, was greater. This convincingly shows how inaccurate information about sleep affects waking performance of healthy people, and it is conceivable that the effects of feedback about sleep are even greater in people who are anxious about sleep, as in disorders such as insomnia. It is also reasonable to think that the mere process of tracking sleep using devices can affect sleep, both via any direct effects of devices — for instance, discomfort while wearing a head-worn device — and via indirect effects — consider the instance of someone anxious about sleep anticipating what their sleep data will reveal. This highlights the importance of providing guidance regarding how to interpret data from sleep trackers, and such guidance was recently found to improve insomnia symptoms168 Reflections on the dawn of “smart” sleeping environments Several companies have commercialized “smart” bedroom products in the last few years, with initial efforts including smart mattresses and mattress covers that use nearable sleep, pulse rate, and respiratory data to modify in-bed conditions to support sleep health. There is a coherent rationale behind such products, which will surely progress in their validity, features, and advantages in years to come. Regarding validity, accurate monitoring of the environment and sleep is foundational to realizing the potential of smart bedroom environments. The ability to concurrently monitor the effects of multiple environmental exposures on sleep in the home environment was recently demonstrated.169 Accurate assessment of sleep and environmental stimuli is required to intervene to improve sleep health trajectories, whether to prevent the transition to circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders or to treat existing sleep disturbances. Several factors complicate accurate classification of circadian rhythms and sleep architecture, however. Using unwell patients as an example of this, traditional biomarkers of circadian rhythms can be confounded by the presence of pathology (fever, for instance) and use of medications. Sleep staging is prone to difficulties too. In unwell patients, for example, N2 sleep often lacks its characteristic sleep spindles and K-complexes,170 sometimes requiring alternative sleep staging classification such as Fast Fourier transformation.171 There are also compelling reasons to question the premise that it is appropriate to classify a person as being in a single sleep stage at any one instant during sleep. Indeed, recent data from people who have epilepsy indicate that different brain regions are frequently in deviating sleep stages concurrently, with the hippocampus tending to forecast the next stage the cortex will enter, with similar regional heterogeneity of sleep stages also expected in health humans.172 Such divergence in sleep stages in distinct parts of the brain might help explain phenomena such as sleep state misperception and lucid dreaming, and the ability to monitor this divergence instantaneously may soon permit more effective sleep promoting interventions than are currently possible. Ultimately, smart sleep environments could use closed-loop systems in which variables such as mattress and pillow support, AT, RH, particulate matter in the air, mattress and pillow\n",

    "In today's episode of the Nourish Balance Thrive Podcast, we delved deep into the realm of sleep health, particularly focusing on the role of sleep wearables and nearables. Here's a summary of the key takeaways from our discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sleep Wearables and Nearables Track Sleep**: We explored how these devices passively monitor various sleep metrics such as duration, phases, and disturbances, offering a convenient and objective way to gather data on our sleep patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Monitoring as a Cornerstone of Behavior Change**: We discussed the importance of self-monitoring in the context of behavior change. By actively tracking our sleep habits, we gain insights that can lead to meaningful improvements in sleep quality and, consequently, athletic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variability and Opacity in Proprietary Sleep and Stress Scores**: We acknowledged that the scores provided by these devices, though helpful, can vary and sometimes be opaque in their calculation methods. It's essential to understand the limitations of these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Process Over Outcome**: Emphasizing Simon Marshall's wisdom, we stressed the importance of focusing on the behaviors that lead to the desired outcome rather than the outcome itself. It's more beneficial to track and adjust behaviors influencing sleep quality than to fixate solely on the sleep efficiency percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sleep-State Misperception and Imperfections in Tracking Devices**: We addressed the concept of sleep-state misperception, where there can be a discrepancy between the data reported by devices and how we subjectively feel about our sleep. This highlights the need to consider both objective data and our subjective experience when assessing sleep quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these points contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how we can use technology to enhance our sleep health while also recognizing the importance of our own perceptions and behaviors in this process. Our discussion today serves as a guide to navigating the complex world of sleep tracking, aiming to help you achieve optimal sleep for better athletic performance and overall well-being."
