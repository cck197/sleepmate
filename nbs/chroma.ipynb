       " Document(page_content='\\n        Your goal is to ask the human to do the SEEDS exercise created by Simon\\n        Marshall, PhD. Explain briefly what\\'s involved and then ask if they\\'d\\n        like to know more. Once they confirm by saying something like\\n        \"k\", \"okay\", \"ok\", \"yes\", \"y\", \"sure\", \"yeah\", \"yep\", \"ready\", summarise the exercise using the following:\\n        \\n        The pillars of good health are Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and\\n        Stress management (SEEDS). Yes, \"SEEDS\" is cheesy as fuck, but the\\n        metaphor of planting small SEEDS (i.e., behaviors that are good for you)\\n        and watering them every day so they can take root (i.e., become habits\\n        that you don\\'t have to constantly think about them) is consistent with\\n        the science of behavior change and habit formation. So, while the\\n        acronym may be the Celine Dion of behavior change, it WORKS. Besides,\\n        what\\'s life without cheese?\\n\\n        For each of these pillars of good health, think of a tiny thing that you\\n        can do to contribute to it. This is not the place for grandiose,\\n        aspirational intentions (e.g., \"run 5km\" or \"eat no added sugar\" if\\n        you\\'ve never come close this in the past), or the fat-chance outcomes\\n        (e.g., \"get sleep 8 hours per night\" when you\\'re currently getting 5\\n        hrs). In SEEDS, we\\'re focusing on tiny little behaviors that contribute\\n        to good outcomes. The behavioral science is that focusing on SMALL\\n        behaviors builds the correct mindset and contributes to knock-on effects\\n        on other changes in that Pillar.  In short, progress begets progress.\\n        So, a good way to think about each SEED is that your reaction to it\\n        should be \"shit, even I could do that,\" not \"urgh, I mean, I\\'ll give it\\n        a go but don\\'t hold your breath.\"\\n\\n        Simon likes to use three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 teeny-weeny\\n        daily habits. If that sounds like A LOT to you, he recommends you\\n        prioritize them.  The top line is what you\\'ll start with. Once you\\'ve\\n        done these consistently, add the second line, and so on. Regardless, try\\n        to first WRITE IN all fifteen in this exercise.\\n\\n        You\\'ll see that this also gives us a way to way to measure progress and\\n        consistency. Later we\\'ll ask what you got done and give you a score\\n        (/15) for how many you managed to do that day. The importance of the\\n        score will become more evident when we progress to Phase 2 of our Celine\\n        Dion exercise, the veritable Kenny G of stress management mojo - a\\n        Traffic Light system to avoid catastrophizing, awfulizing, and\\n        why-can\\'t-I-do this-izing, when life gets in the way (because it will).\\n        We need to give ourselves permission to occasionally suck at adulting.\\n\\n        Before collecting SEEDS from the human, give some examples:\\n        - Be in bed by 9.30 pm.\\n        - Go to bed *only* when sleepy.\\n        - Set an alarm and get up at the same time every day.\\n        - Go for 2 min walk when you feel the need for a nap.\\n        - Turn off my cell phone by 8 pm.\\n        - Walk outside for 10 ten minutes before 9:30 am.\\n        - Do 10 push-ups while the coffee is brewing.\\n        - Eat one meal with chopsticks (to slow down eating).\\n        - Eat 50g of protein with every meal.\\n        - Don\\'t drink out of anything plastic.\\n        - Drink fizzy water from 6-8 pm (for booze cravings).\\n        - Write down three tiny things I\\'ve been grateful for today.\\n        - No caffeine after 12 pm.\\n        - Do the \"leaves on a stream\" or \"open focus\" exercises (for stress).\\n        - ...you get the idea.\\n\\n        Collect the SEEDS from the human one category at a time. \\n\\n        Once you have all the SEEDS defined, STOP! Summarise the results\\n        in a bullet list and ask if they\\'re correct.\\n\\n        Only once the human has confirmed correctness, save the SEEDS to\\n        the database.\\n        \\n        Finally, retrieve the entry from the database and\\n        summarise\\n        ', metadata={'goal': 'seeds_probe'}),\n",
