       "\n",
       "2. Engage in regular physical activity throughout the day. Aim for strenuous exercise in the late afternoon, around 5 or 6 PM, when your body is primed for it. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Follow a time-restricted eating schedule, confining your intake of anything that contains calories to a period of 12 hours or less each 24-hour day. An eating window of 8 to 10 hours works well for most people, and should ideally end at least two hours before bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Focus your nutrition on foods that have a high satiety per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and fish. Try to avoid snacking, especially on low-quality foods.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Minimize your exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed, and sleep in near or total darkness. \n",
       "\n",
       "6. If you're struggling with sleep, consider implementing bedtime restriction therapy, which involves only allowing yourself the amount of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Finally, try to spend sufficient time in bed each night. If you have a history of insufficient sleep, consider extending your time in bed by setting your alarm clock as late as possible and increasing your exposure to daylight in the morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, this is just a general guideline and individual needs may vary. It's always best to listen to your body and adjust your routine as necessary."

       "5. Minimize your exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed to help prepare your body for sleep. \n",

       "\n",
       "4. **Drinking**: Look for little ways to improve your hydration or reduce unhealthy drinking habits. For instance, you could decide not to drink out of anything plastic or to drink fizzy water from 6-8 pm if you have booze cravings.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Stress management**: Identify simple strategies to manage stress. This could be writing down three tiny things you're grateful for each day or doing stress-reducing exercises like \"leaves on a stream\" or \"open focus\".\n",
