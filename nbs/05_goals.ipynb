       "1. **Morning**: Start the day with a consistent wake-up time. Spend at least an hour outdoors in daylight each day to reset your body's internal clock. This is especially beneficial if you're trying to shift your sleep cycle earlier. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Mid-Morning to Afternoon**: Engage in regular physical activity. Your body is primed for strenuous exercise in the late biological afternoon, around five or six PM. However, it's also beneficial to move frequently throughout the day, even if it's low-intensity activity. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Meal Times**: Practice time-restricted eating, confining your intake of anything that contains calories to a period of twelve hours or less each twenty-four-hour day. An eating window of eight to ten hours works well for most people, and it should end at least two hours before bed. Focus your nutrition on foods that have a high satiety per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and fish. \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Evening**: Minimize your exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed. This helps give your body's central clock strong time cues. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Bedtime**: Aim for a consistent bedtime each night, only going to bed when you're actually sleepy. Sleep in near or total darkness to optimize your body's internal clock. \n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Throughout the Day**: Practice problem-focused coping strategies to address the underlying cause of stress. This could involve scheduling worry time, where you dedicate a specific period each day to worry. \n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, this is a general routine and might not suit everyone's individual needs or lifestyle. It's always important to listen to your body and adjust your routine as necessary."

       "\n",
       "3. **If you can't sleep, get out of bed**: If you're unable to fall asleep or go back to sleep within about 20 minutes, get out of bed and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy again. This prevents your brain from associating the bed with wakefulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Wake up at the same time every day**: This helps regulate your body's internal clock, making it easier to fall asleep and wake up.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Avoid daytime napping**: While a quick power nap can be refreshing, long or frequent naps can make it harder to sleep at night.\n",
       "\n",

Now that we've identified and categorised your stress-related behaviours, we can start working on strategies to manage them. This will involve increasing the adaptive behaviours and reducing the maladaptive ones. Are you ready to continue on your health journey?\\nHuman: ready\\nAI: Great! Let's start by focusing on the adaptive behaviours. These are the behaviours that help you cope with stress in a healthy way. \\n\\nFor example, you mentioned that you exercise, ask for help, use logic to avoid over-exaggerating the stressor, prioritise and segment tasks, clean or tidy up, listen to calming sounds, socialise with friends, and use humour to lighten the mood. \\n\\nThese are all excellent strategies! I would encourage you to continue doing these things when you're feeling stressed. \\n\\nNow, let's talk about the maladaptive behaviours. These are the behaviours that might feel good in the moment, but they don't actually help you cope with stress in the long run. \\n\\nFor example, you mentioned that you drink more coffee, complain or talk out loud about the stressor, buy things online, procrastinate or falsely prioritise tasks, watch TV or scroll through social media, and eat simple carbohydrates. \\n\\nIt's completely normal to engage in these behaviours when you're feeling stressed, but they might be making things worse in the long run. Would you be open to exploring some alternative strategies?\\nHuman: yes, I would\\nAI: Wonderful, Chris! Let's start with the behaviour of drinking more coffee. While caffeine can give you a temporary energy boost, it can also increase feelings of anxiety and make it harder to sleep. \\n\\nInstead of reaching for another cup of coffee, you might try going for a short walk, doing a few minutes of deep breathing, or even just standing up and stretching. These activities can help increase your energy levels without the negative side effects of caffeine.\\n\\nAs for the other maladaptive behaviours, we can work on finding healthier alternatives. For example, instead of complaining about the stressor, you might try writing about your feelings in a journal. Instead of procrastinating, you might try breaking the task into smaller, more manageable parts. \\n\\nDoes this sound like a plan you'd be willing to try?\\nHuman: yes, I'll try\\nAI: That's the spirit, Chris! Remember, change takes time and it's perfectly okay to take small steps. I'm here to support you on your health journey.

       "\n",
       "Less is better when it comes to alcohol consumption. To give you an idea of quantities, a pint of beer is typically about two units of alcohol. So, based on the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol, you should finish consuming a pint of beer at least three hours before bed. If it was two pints of beer, that would be four units plus one hour, so you should finish your two pints of beer at least five hours before bed. \n",
       "\n",
