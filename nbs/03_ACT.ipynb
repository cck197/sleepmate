      "Human: ok\n",

      "Human: ok\n",
      "AI: Great job, Chris. Now, let's proceed to the next step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now, for the next few minutes, take each thought that enters your mind and place it on one of the leaves… let it float by. Do this with each thought – pleasurable, painful, neutral, whatever it is. Even if you have joyous or enthusiastic thoughts, place them on a leaf and let them float by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please let me know when you're ready for the next step.\n",
      "Human: ok\n",
      "AI: Well done, Chris. Let's move on to the next step.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If your thoughts momentarily stop, continue to watch the stream. Sooner or later, your thoughts will start up again. Allow the stream to flow at its own pace. Don't try to speed it up and rush your thoughts along. You're not trying to rush the leaves along or get rid of your thoughts. You're allowing them to come and go at their own pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know when you're ready to move on.\n",
      "Human: ok\n",
      "AI: You're doing great, Chris. Now, let's go to the final step.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If your mind says “This is dumb,” “I’m bored,” or “I'm not doing this right” place those thoughts on leaves, too, and let them pass. If a leaf gets stuck, allow it to hang around until it's ready to float by. If a thought comes up again, watch it float by another time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spend some time practicing this. When you're ready, gently bring your attention back to your physical surroundings and open your eyes if they were closed.\n",
