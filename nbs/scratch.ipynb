       "- It features the slowest brain waves during the sleep cycle, known as delta waves.\n",
       "- It is considered the most restorative phase of sleep, during which the body repairs and regrows tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens the immune system.\n",
       "- N3 sleep is associated with memory consolidation, particularly the conversion of short-term memories into long-term storage.\n",
       "- It typically makes up 20-25% of a normal adult's sleep cycle and is more prevalent in the first half of the night.\n",
       "- The proportion of N3 sleep can be increased with certain interventions, such as auditory stimulation with non-phase-locked pink noise.\n",

       "1. **Comfort**: A comfortable mattress that provides the right balance of support and softness can help reduce physical discomfort and pain, which might otherwise interrupt deep sleep cycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Support**: Proper support from a mattress helps maintain spinal alignment, which can prevent tossing and turning that might disrupt the progression into deeper stages of sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Temperature Regulation**: Mattresses that retain too much heat can cause you to become too warm, leading to sleep disturbances. Conversely, a mattress that aids in temperature regulation can promote uninterrupted N3 sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Pressure Relief**: A mattress that relieves pressure points by distributing your body weight evenly can reduce the likelihood of waking up during the night, thus allowing for longer periods of deep sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Motion Isolation**: If you share your bed, a mattress with good motion isolation can minimize the impact of your partner's movements, helping you maintain deep sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Material**: The materials used in a mattress, such as memory foam, latex, or innerspring, can affect breathability, comfort, and support, all of which contribute to the quality of N3 sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Age of Mattress**: Over time, mattresses can lose their supportive qualities and become less comfortable, which can hinder your ability to achieve deep sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ensuring that your mattress is conducive to good sleep hygiene can help you maximize the amount of restorative N3 sleep you get each night."

       "Alcohol can significantly disrupt sleep and the body's biological clock. It can affect various levels of the body's system, including the central clock and the muscle clock. The timing and dosage of alcohol consumption are crucial factors in its impact on sleep. Generally, consuming alcohol earlier in the day is better for sleep quality. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, the quantity of alcohol consumed also plays a significant role. Consuming less alcohol is better for sleep. For instance, it's recommended to consume no more than four units of alcohol in a day. A unit of alcohol is equivalent to the amount of alcohol in ten milliliters or eight grams of pure ethanol. \n",
       "\n",
       "To minimize the impact of alcohol on sleep, it's recommended to allow at least one hour before bed per unit consumed plus one additional hour. For example, if you consume two units of alcohol (equivalent to a pint of beer), you should finish drinking at least three hours before bed. This recommendation is based on the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol. \n",
       "\n",
       "It's also important to note that alcohol can disrupt the biological clock at many different levels, which can lead to sleep disruptions and other health issues. Therefore, it's crucial to moderate alcohol consumption to maintain good sleep health."

Here are some guidelines for what you should eat:\\n\\n1. **Protein Sources**: Your diet should include a few staple protein sources that you are familiar with. These could be pastured eggs, wild-caught salmon, and grass-fed beef. Other good options include ruminants (beef, lamb, bison), poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, wild game, pork, legumes, and fermented dairy (plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese). Always opt for animals that are eating what they are supposed to be eating. For example, choose grass-fed meats, free-range organic chicken, and pastured pork when possible. \\n\\n2. **Carbohydrates**: If you are eating carbohydrates, make sure you have some low energy density high satiety choices available, like apples, carrots, berries, and potatoes. \\n\\n3. **Emergency Protein Sources**: Keep emergency protein sources nearby. Hard-boiled eggs and individually packaged grass-fed beef sticks (without sugar) are good options. \\n\\n4. **Convenient Options**: For times when you are starving but have no time at all, consider some whey powder and a shaker bottle. \\n\\n5. **Species-Appropriate Diet**: Humans are hunter-gatherers, and we do have a species-appropriate diet. Start with a basic Paleo-ish template as a starting point. \\n\\n6. **P:E Ratio**: The P:E Diet is all about food choice. You are specifically choosing one food, over other possible food options, because it is going to provide you with a higher level of nutrient satietyâ€”allowing you to eat less energy overall. \\n\\n7. **Seafood**: Shrimp is another delicious seafood with an amazing protein to energy ratio and plenty of nutrients, including iodine and omega-three fats. \\n\\nRemember, the key is to set yourself up for success by having these foods available as often as possible. This will make you far less likely to fall off the wagon and end up in the drive-through of your favorite fast food place.')),\n",

It is a central nervous system depressant that can have both short-term and long-term effects on various aspects of health. \\n\\nIn the short term, alcohol can affect mood, cognition, and motor skills. It can lead to feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and lowered inhibitions, but it can also impair judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short period can lead to alcohol poisoning, a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nIn the long term, regular heavy drinking can lead to a range of health problems. These include liver disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological damage, and an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Alcohol can also contribute to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can lead to alcohol dependence or addiction.\\n\\nAlcohol can also disrupt the biological clock at many different levels, including the central clock in the brain and the muscle clock. Like caffeine, the dose and timing of alcohol consumption matter. In general, earlier consumption is better, and less is better. \\n\\nOne unit of alcohol is the amount in 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure ethanol. To get an idea of the unit quantities of common drinks, resources such as the unit calculator at drinkaware.co.uk and alcoholchange.org.uk can be used. \\n\\nIt's recommended to allow at least one hour before bed per unit consumed plus one hour. For example, a pint of beer is typically about two units, so it would be recommended to finish drinking it at least three hours before bed. This is due to the rate at which the body can detoxify alcohol. \\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that these are general guidelines and individual responses to alcohol can vary. It's always important to drink responsibly and be aware of the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption.\"))]"

       "\n",
       "1. **Protein Sources**: Your diet should include a few staple protein sources that you are familiar with. These could be pastured eggs, wild-caught salmon, and grass-fed beef. Other good options include ruminants (beef, lamb, bison), poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, wild game, pork, legumes, and fermented dairy (plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese). Always opt for animals that are eating what they are supposed to be eating. For example, choose grass-fed meats, free-range organic chicken, and pastured pork when possible. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Carbohydrates**: If you are eating carbohydrates, make sure you have some low energy density high satiety choices available, like apples, carrots, berries, and potatoes. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Emergency Protein Sources**: Keep emergency protein sources nearby. Hard-boiled eggs and individually packaged grass-fed beef sticks (without sugar) are good options. \n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Convenient Options**: For times when you are starving but have no time at all, consider some whey powder and a shaker bottle. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Species-Appropriate Diet**: Humans are hunter-gatherers, and we do have a species-appropriate diet. Start with a basic Paleo-ish template as a starting point. \n",
       "\n",
       "6. **P:E Ratio**: The P:E Diet is all about food choice. You are specifically choosing one food, over other possible food options, because it is going to provide you with a higher level of nutrient satietyâ€”allowing you to eat less energy overall. \n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Seafood**: Shrimp is another delicious seafood with an amazing protein to energy ratio and plenty of nutrients, including iodine and omega-three fats. \n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, the key is to set yourself up for success by having these foods available as often as possible. This will make you far less likely to fall off the wagon and end up in the drive-through of your favorite fast food place."

Now, could you please tell me about your current occupation?\\nHuman: coder\\nAI: Ah, a coder! That's a job that requires a lot of mental gymnastics. Now, could you please tell me about your typical work hours?\\nHuman: 7 - 6 with breaks\\nAI: Thank you, Chris. That's quite a long day, but I'm glad to hear you're taking breaks. Now, let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?\\nHuman: nope\\nAI: That's great to hear, Chris. Now, how about alcohol? Do you drink, and if so, how often?\\nHuman: some alchohol, mostly at the weekends\\nAI: Thank you for sharing, Chris. It's important to enjoy life's pleasures in moderation. Now, could you please tell me about your level of physical activity?\\nHuman: I'm a cyclist, surfer, lift weights\\nAI: Impressive, Chris! You're quite the active individual. Now, could you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?\\nHuman: three eggs and sausages for breakfast, salad and protein for lunch, meat and veg for dinner. 1g protein per lb of bodyweight\\nAI: Sounds like a well-rounded diet, Chris. Now, do you have any existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc.?\\nHuman: none\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Now, are you currently taking any medications?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: Great, Chris. Now, is there a family history of insomnia or other sleep disorders?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Now, do you have a history of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, etc.?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Are you currently undergoing any psychological treatment?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: Thank you for sharing, Chris. Now, who are you currently living with? Alone, family, friends?\\nHuman: live with family, three kids, in a house but sleep in a VW Eurovan\\nAI: Sounds like quite the adventure, Chris! Now, could you describe the noise level in your living area?\\nHuman: it's very rural and quiet\\nAI: That sounds peaceful, Chris. Now, could you tell me what success looks like to you?\\nHuman: sleep through the night, wake up feeling refreshed\\nAI: That's a wonderful goal, Chris. Now, could you tell me about anything you've tried previously that helped you achieve this?\\nHuman: getting enough daylight\\nAI: That's a great strategy, Chris. Daylight can indeed help regulate our sleep-wake cycle. Now, could you tell me about anything you've tried previously that didn't help?\\nHuman: apigenin\\nAI: I see, not all remedies work for everyone. Lastly, is there anything else you'd like to add to your health history?\""

Try to avoid mindless snacking, as it often leads to consumption of low-quality foods.\\n\\n5. Minimize your exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed, and sleep in near or total darkness to give your body\\'s central clock strong time cues. \\n\\n6.

The behavioural science is that focusing on SMALL behaviours builds the correct mindset and contributes to knock-on effects on other changes in that Pillar. In short, progress begets progress.\\n\\nSimon likes to use three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 teeny-weeny daily habits. If that sounds like A LOT to you, he recommends you prioritise them.
