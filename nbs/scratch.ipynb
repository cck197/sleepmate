It's a bit like planting a garden, but instead of flowers or vegetables, we're cultivating good habits. \\n\\nSEEDS stands for Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management. The idea is to identify small, manageable actions that contribute to each of these areas. We're not aiming for grand gestures here, but rather tiny behaviours that can become habits over time. \\n\\nWould you like to know more about this exercise?\")),\n",

The idea is to plant these \"SEEDS\" and water them every day so they can take root and become habits. \\n\\nHere\\'s a brief rundown:\\n\\n1. **Sleep**: Think of small actions that can improve your sleep. For example, being in bed by 9.30 pm or turning off your cell phone by 8 pm.\\n\\n2. **Exercise**: Identify tiny steps that can increase your physical activity. This could be something like walking outside for 10 minutes before 9:30 am or doing 10 push-ups while the coffee is brewing.\\n\\n3. **Eating**: Consider small changes to your diet that can make a big difference. This might be eating one meal with chopsticks to slow down your eating or ensuring you eat 50g of protein with every meal.\\n\\n4. **Drinking**: Look for little ways to improve your hydration or reduce unhealthy drinking habits. For instance, you could decide not to drink out of anything plastic or to drink fizzy water from 6-8 pm if you have booze cravings.\\n\\n5. **Stress management**: Identify simple strategies to manage stress. This could be writing down three tiny things you\\'re grateful for each day or doing stress-reducing exercises like \"leaves on a stream\" or \"open focus\".\\n\\nThe goal is to come up with three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 daily habits. If that sounds like a lot, don\\'t worry! You can start with the top line and add more as you become comfortable with them.\\n\\nDoes this make sense so far?')),\n",
