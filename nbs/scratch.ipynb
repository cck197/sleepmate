Spend at least an hour outdoors in daylight to reset your body's central clock. This can be done through a morning walk or exercise. \\n\\n2. **Mid-Morning to Afternoon (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)**: Engage in work or other productive activities. Try to move frequently throughout the day, even if it's low-intensity activity, to support blood sugar control and brain function. \\n\\n3. **Late Afternoon (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**: This is the ideal time for strenuous exercise as your body is primed for it. \\n\\n4. **Evening (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM)**: Have your last meal of the day, ideally ending at least two hours before bed. This is part of the time-restricted eating window, which should be 8-10 hours. \\n\\n5. **Night (8:00 PM - 10:00 PM)**: Minimize exposure to bright overhead lights to prepare your body for sleep. Engage in relaxing activities like reading or listening to calm music. \\n\\n6. **Bedtime (10:00 PM)**: Sleep in near or total darkness to give your body's central clock a strong time cue. \\n\\nRemember, this is a general routine and individual needs may vary. It's also important to focus on nutrition, consuming foods with high satiety per calorie such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and fish. Avoid snacking mindlessly and try to stick to the eating window. \\n\\nThis routine also emphasizes the importance of managing stress through problem-focused strategies and maintaining a healthy sleep schedule. If you're struggling with sleep, consider bedtime restriction therapy or other sleep consolidation therapies. \\n\\nLastly, remember to give your body a day of rest in the week, following the biblical training week concept.

The timing and dosage of alcohol consumption are crucial factors in its impact on sleep. Generally, consuming alcohol earlier in the day is better for sleep quality. \n",

       "However, the quantity of alcohol consumed also plays a significant role. Consuming less alcohol is better for sleep. For instance, it's recommended to consume no more than four units of alcohol in a day. A unit of alcohol is equivalent to the amount of alcohol in ten milliliters or eight grams of pure ethanol. \n",
       "\n",
       "To minimize the impact of alcohol on sleep, it's recommended to allow at least one hour before bed per unit consumed plus one additional hour. For example, if you consume two units of alcohol (equivalent to a pint of beer), you should finish drinking at least three hours before bed. This recommendation is based on the rate at which your body can detoxify alcohol. \n",

Other good options include ruminants (beef, lamb, bison), poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, wild game, pork, legumes, and fermented dairy (plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese).

For example, choose grass-fed meats, free-range organic chicken, and pastured pork when possible. \\n\\n2. **Carbohydrates**: If you are eating carbohydrates, make sure you have some low energy density high satiety choices available, like apples, carrots, berries, and potatoes. \\n\\n3. **Emergency Protein Sources**: Keep emergency protein sources nearby. Hard-boiled eggs and individually packaged grass-fed beef sticks (without sugar) are good options. \\n\\n4. **Convenient Options**: For times when you are starving but have no time at all, consider some whey powder and a shaker bottle. \\n\\n5. **Species-Appropriate Diet**: Humans are hunter-gatherers, and we do have a species-appropriate diet. Start with a basic Paleo-ish template as a starting point. \\n\\n6. **P:E Ratio**: The P:E Diet is all about food choice. You are specifically choosing one food, over other possible food options, because it is going to provide you with a higher level of nutrient satiety—allowing you to eat less energy overall. \\n\\n7. **Seafood**: Shrimp is another delicious seafood with an amazing protein to energy ratio and plenty of nutrients, including iodine and omega-three fats. \\n\\nRemember, the key is to set yourself up for success by having these foods available as often as possible. This will make you far less likely to fall off the wagon and end up in the drive-through of your favorite fast food place.')),\n",

It is a central nervous system depressant that can have both short-term and long-term effects on various aspects of health. \\n\\nIn the short term, alcohol can affect mood, cognition, and motor skills. It can lead to feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and lowered inhibitions, but it can also impair judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short period can lead to alcohol poisoning, a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.\\n\\nIn the long term, regular heavy drinking can lead to a range of health problems. These include liver disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological damage, and an increased risk of certain types of cancer. Alcohol can also contribute to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can lead to alcohol dependence or addiction.\\n\\nAlcohol can also disrupt the biological clock at many different levels, including the central clock in the brain and the muscle clock. Like caffeine, the dose and timing of alcohol consumption matter. In general, earlier consumption is better, and less is better. \\n\\nOne unit of alcohol is the amount in 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure ethanol. To get an idea of the unit quantities of common drinks, resources such as the unit calculator at drinkaware.co.uk and alcoholchange.org.uk can be used. \\n\\nIt's recommended to allow at least one hour before bed per unit consumed plus one hour. For example, a pint of beer is typically about two units, so it would be recommended to finish drinking it at least three hours before bed. This is due to the rate at which the body can detoxify alcohol. \\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that these are general guidelines and individual responses to alcohol can vary. It's always important to drink responsibly and be aware of the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption.\"))]"

Would now be a good time to go through a health history questionnaire? It's a bit like a check-up, but without the cold stethoscope.\\nHuman: not bad, a bit tired\\nAI: It sounds like you're feeling a bit worn out, which is completely understandable in our fast-paced world. Let's proceed with the health history questionnaire, shall we? It might even be a nice distraction. Let's start with an easy one: what is your sex?\\nHuman: man\\nAI: Thank you, Chris. Now, could you please share your date of birth? Don't worry, I won't be sending any surprise birthday parties your way.\\nHuman: Feb 13 1976\\nAI: Thank you, Chris. You're still a spring chicken! Now, could you please tell me about your current occupation?\\nHuman: coder\\nAI: Ah, a coder! That's a job that requires a lot of mental gymnastics. Now, could you please tell me about your typical work hours?\\nHuman: 7 - 6 with breaks\\nAI: Thank you, Chris. That's quite a long day, but I'm glad to hear you're taking breaks. Now, let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke?\\nHuman: nope\\nAI: That's great to hear, Chris. Now, how about alcohol? Do you drink, and if so, how often?\\nHuman: some alchohol, mostly at the weekends\\nAI: Thank you for sharing, Chris. It's important to enjoy life's pleasures in moderation. Now, could you please tell me about your level of physical activity?\\nHuman: I'm a cyclist, surfer, lift weights\\nAI: Impressive, Chris! You're quite the active individual. Now, could you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?\\nHuman: three eggs and sausages for breakfast, salad and protein for lunch, meat and veg for dinner. 1g protein per lb of bodyweight\\nAI: Sounds like a well-rounded diet, Chris. Now, do you have any existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, etc.?\\nHuman: none\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Now, are you currently taking any medications?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: Great, Chris. Now, is there a family history of insomnia or other sleep disorders?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Now, do you have a history of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, etc.?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: That's good to hear, Chris. Are you currently undergoing any psychological treatment?\\nHuman: no\\nAI: Thank you for sharing, Chris. Now, who are you currently living with? Alone, family, friends?\\nHuman: live with family, three kids, in a house but sleep in a VW Eurovan\\nAI: Sounds like quite the adventure, Chris! Now, could you describe the noise level in your living area?\\nHuman: it's very rural and quiet\\nAI: That sounds peaceful, Chris. Now, could you tell me what success looks like to you?\\nHuman: sleep through the night, wake up feeling refreshed\\nAI: That's a wonderful goal, Chris. Now, could you tell me about anything you've tried previously that helped you achieve this?\\nHuman: getting enough daylight\\nAI: That's a great strategy, Chris. Daylight can indeed help regulate our sleep-wake cycle. Now, could you tell me about anything you've tried previously that didn't help?\\nHuman: apigenin\\nAI: I see, not all remedies work for everyone. Lastly, is there anything else you'd like to add to your health history?\""

Aim to eat within a window of 8 to 10 hours, ending at least two hours before bed. This practice, known as time-restricted eating, can help regulate your body\\'s peripheral clocks. \\n\\n4. Focus your nutrition on foods that have a high satiety per calorie, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and fish. Try to avoid mindless snacking, as it often leads to consumption of low-quality foods.\\n\\n5. Minimize your exposure to bright overhead lights in the three hours before bed, and sleep in near or total darkness to give your body\\'s central clock strong time cues. \\n\\n6. If you\\'re struggling with sleep, consider implementing bedtime restriction therapy, which involves only allowing yourself the amount of time in bed that you\\'re actually asleep on a regular basis. \\n\\n7.

It\\'s a bit like gardening, but instead of plants, we\\'re cultivating good health habits. \\n\\nThe pillars of good health are Sleep, Exercise, Eating, Drinking, and Stress management (SEEDS). Yes, \"SEEDS\" is as cheesy as a fondue party, but the metaphor of planting small SEEDS (i.e., behaviours that are good for you) and watering them every day so they can take root (i.e., become habits that you don\\'t have to constantly think about) is consistent with the science of behaviour change and habit formation. \\n\\nSo, while the acronym may be the Celine Dion of behaviour change, it WORKS.

This isn\\'t the place for grand, aspirational intentions, but rather for small, achievable actions. \\n\\nFor example, instead of saying \"run 5km\" or \"eat no added sugar\", we\\'re looking for things like \"be in bed by 9.30 pm\", \"go for a 2 min walk when you feel the need for a nap\", or \"eat one meal with chopsticks to slow down eating\". \\n\\nThe idea is to focus on small behaviours that contribute to good outcomes. The behavioural science is that focusing on SMALL behaviours builds the correct mindset and contributes to knock-on effects on other changes in that Pillar. In short, progress begets progress.\\n\\nSimon likes to use three SEEDS per pillar, for a total of 15 teeny-weeny daily habits. If that sounds like A LOT to you, he recommends you prioritise them. The top line is what you\\'ll start with. Once you\\'ve done these consistently, add the second line, and so on. \\n\\nAre you ready to start defining your SEEDS? We\\'ll go one category at a time.
