      "● Get plenty of exposure to daylight: Aim to spend at least 30 minutes outdoors in daylight\n",
      "each day, preferably in the first half of your waking day. Why not take an early lunch\n",
      "break outdoors with others?\n",
      "● Limit your consumption of stimulants such as caffeine: Cap your intake at 2 mg caffeine\n",
      "per kg body mass per day (use this site to estimate your intake), finishing your last\n",
      "caffeine-containing item by at least 9 hours before bedtime. Swap your caffeinated\n",

      "vigorous-intensity and/or high workload physical activity by at least 4 hours before\n",
      "bedtime, finish moderate-intensity physical activity at least 2 hours before bedtime. Don’t\n",
      "worry, sex doesn’t count and often helps people sleep… so get busy.\n",

      "consuming fluids at this time too if you’re prone to needing to pee during the sleep\n",
      "period.\n",
      "Notice that these guidelines are all relative to your sleep timing, not time of day. There are very\n",

      "these guidelines to begin. Pain and sleep in athletes\n",

      "first. Two ways of tracking sleep are:\n",
      "1) Using devices: There’s now a panoply of sleep-tracking devices out there, the most\n",
      "common of which are finger- or wrist-worn. While I can’t claim this confidently when\n",

      "of writing, I wouldn’t pay attention to things like sleep stages or sleep “scores” - just\n",
      "focus on the sleep timing and duration data.\n",
      "2) Using a diary: If I had to pick either a wearable or a sleep diary, I’d probably pick a\n",
      "sleep diary. In addition to quantitative measures, how well you feel you slept is important,\n",
      "and an advantage of sleep diaries is that you can record various factors that might affect\n",
      "your sleep. You’d probably prefer to keep a digital diary, so you could try one such as\n",

      "While you’re tracking your baseline sleep, you might want to buy a new mattress. Three key\n",
      "variables to consider when buying a mattress are comfort, durability, and support.\n",
      "In recent years, “bed in a box” mattresses have dramatically increased in popularity. To be\n",
      "foldable, these are made of foam. The problem with this is that foam tends to absorb heat, and\n",
      "you won’t sleep well if you get too hot. Some manufacturers use cooling gels to attempt to\n",
      "overcome this limitation, but it’s unclear how long the gels last. As spring mattresses dissipate\n",
      "heat more efficiently, they’re probably better than foam mattresses for most people. Training\n",
      "Next there is training. Training commonly disrupts sleep by way of its timing and/or its load.\n",
      "Training timing\n",
      "If early or late training overlaps with your habitual sleep period (bearing in mind that it takes time\n",
      "to eat, get ready for training, travel to and from training, wind down from training, and so on),\n",
      "your sleep is likely to suffer. Ideally, you would adjust your schedule to avoid such overlap.\n",
      "However, if your training times can’t be changed then one option is to shift your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, respectively.\n",
      "To shift your sleep earlier, increase your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking for the\n",
      "day ahead. If you can’t expose yourself to daylight, use a light therapy lamp that emits a light\n",
      "intensity of at least 10,000 lux, and use it for at least half an hour. In the evening, avoid exercise\n",
      "in the 4 hours or so before your planned bedtime, and systematically reduce your exposure to\n",
      "light 2 hours before your planned bedtime. If you’re outside at this time and the sun is up, wear\n",
      "sunglasses. If you’re indoors, dim the lights (or turn some lights off) and perhaps use\n",
      "blue-blocking glasses. Finally, to go to sleep earlier, it’s probably best to at least temporarily stop\n",
      "consuming any caffeine during this phase. If you do these things, you should be able to advance\n",
      "your sleep timing by at least 30 minutes each day.\n",
      "To shift your sleep later, reduce your exposure to daylight within 2 hours of waking in the\n",
      "morning. If you’re outside and the sun is up, wear sunglasses. If you’re indoors, use minimal\n",
      "lighting and perhaps use blue-blocking glasses. In the evening, exercising 3 to 5 hours before\n",
      "your planned bedtime will help you delay your sleep. Systematically increase your exposure to\n",
      "light at this time too. If you do these things, you should be able to delay your sleep timing by at\n",
      "least 30 minutes each day. Note that regardless of whether you’re shifting your sleep earlier or\n",
      "later, you should move your diet timing in lockstep with your sleep timing.\n",
      "Training load\n",
      "Regarding training load, you’ve probably noticed that if you test the limits of your recovery your\n",
      "sleep soon deteriorates. Sleep problems are commonplace during overreaching and\n",
      "overtraining, and the problems generally subside once the balance between training load and\n",
      "ability to recover from training becomes more favourable. Addressing sleep difficulties during\n",
      "these periods entails modifying training loads (if possible) and being particularly fastidious about we won't procreate and subsequently pass on our genes, but we can think of sleep as being the price that we pay for weightfulness. It's something that optimizes our bodies\n",
      "for things like being physically active for acquiring food and meet. And so in this way,\n",
      "the clock's ability\n",
      "to anticipate events\n",
      "in the environment\n",
      "and align biology with those events\n",
      "is actually a darwinian fitness characteristic\n",
      "by which I mean that if we were active at\n",
      "inappropriate times a day, we might be more likely to run into predators, for example.\n",
      "You might be less likely to find food than meats,\n",
      "and so be more likely to get popped out of the gene pool\n",
      "and less prone passing on our genes to subsequent generations.\n",
      "While this is quite difficult to demonstrate in humans,\n",
      "there is some evidence thing that this is indeed the case.\n",
      "There's a particular type of experiment called a resonance experiment\n",
      "that showed this very nicely.\n",
      "One of the early ones was done by Kyle Johnson\n",
      "at Vanderbilt University in nineteen ninety eight. And what they did was they took cyanobacteria\n",
      "that I mentioned earlier,\n",
      "and they grew different strains of these bacteria that have different\n",
      "body clocks so their clocks take at different speeds each day.\n",
      "They grew them in dishes\n",
      "under different light dark cycle lengths.\n",
      "Some of those cycles were longer than others.\n",
      "What they found was that strains that had intrinsic clocks that better match the light dark cycle\n",
      "outcompeted the other strains for resources\n",
      "resulting in larger colonies of these bacteria over time.\n",
      "Subsequently, there has been some work showing this in mammals like ourselves too. Mikaela How did a really nice experiment in two thousand\n",
      "in which she found that mice with near twenty four hour body clocks survive longer\n",
      "and\n",
      "were more likely to reproduce than mice that had very fast clocks as a result of a gene mutation that speeds up the clock.\n",
      "Another characteristic of flocks that's important to understand is that they help us adapt to changes in the environment. We can see this in many ways, but fundamentally\n",
      "our clocks track the photo period each day. This is what enables us to adjust to jet lag if our clocks weren't able to adapt, so we'd be stuck in our home time zone all the time, regardless\n",
      "of where we travel to.\n",
      "But a really vivid demonstration of this was\n",
      "shown by Ken Wright and his colleagues,\n",
      "and they published a couple of experiments\n",
      "looking at what happens to the clocks of healthy young adults who went camping for several days at different times of years. So one of these trips took place during the summer, and one of them took place during the winter. And before camping,\n",
      "their clocks were similar while at home at these two different times of year, and probably largely because of the modern electrically lit light environment.\n",
      "But after just six days of winter camping,\n",
      "their biological nighttime\n",
      "started a lot earlier than it did before the trip, and also that it did\n",
      "after summer camping, and then the nighttime\n",
      "ended later too. As a result of that, this biological night time and I'll return to exactly what that is later\n",
      "was about four hours longer in the winter than it was in the summer.\n",
      "And so, basically, the biological nighttime that in internal representation\n",
      "of the night,\n",
      "expanded\n",
      "in lost step with the fact that it's dark for longer in the winter than it is during the summer.\n",
      "And then considering this\n",
      "in terms of evolutionary biology,\n",
      "there are certain stresses that can actually potentially cause animals to switch between temporal\n",
      "niches.\n",
      "At least some animals, we don't know that this is true of humans. That's sterile, but there's been some very interesting research over the years on something called food anticipatory\n",
      "activity.\n",
      "The research on this goes way back There was some work showing that food consumption can influence the biological clock and food related behaviors. So things like food, seating, far back as the nineteen twenties,\n",
      "and they basically found that consistent\n",
      "patterns\n",
      "of activity before drinking or eating anything,\n",
      "either wearing the same item of clothing or not wearing any clothes at all. For a lot of people, they might want to do this once or twice a week.\n",
      "I recognize also that this isn't for everyone. If, for example, you've got a history of eating disorders or disordered eating, then it might not be for you. But if you are simply trying to maintain a new lower body weight, then this particular habit can be transformative.\n",
      "Another habit that I think is really helpful for a lot of people that I don't believe has come up in the podcast so far is\n",
      "matching your time in bed to your actual sleep capacity.\n",
      "Tommy spoke about the importance of spending sufficient time in bed, that is very relevant to most people.\n",
      "And frankly, many people benefit from spending slightly more time in bed, specifically\n",
      "if they have a history of insufficient sleep. They have some sort of lifestyle driven sleep loss. For example, they wake up to the alarm clock before work days and then they try and catch up on some sleep on the weekends.\n",
      "These people would benefit from extending their time in bed, perhaps by setting their alarm clock as late as possible,\n",
      "by increasing their exposure to daylight in the morning to shift their clocks early, which will help them fall asleep earlier by reducing their caffeine intake too.\n",
      "And perhaps by reducing their exposure to strong overhead lighting in the three hours or so before bed.\n",
      "For other people, though, specifically people with insomnia type symptoms.\n",
      "They actually benefit from spending less time in bed. One of the core treatments for insomnia is called bedtime restriction therapy\n",
      "or sometimes it's called sleep restriction therapy.\n",
      "Sometimes it's called sleep consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Regardless of what you call it, the idea is to only allow yourself the amounts of time in bed that you're actually asleep on a regular basis because what happens in insomnia is that people spend lots of time awake in bed trying to sleep and unable to sleep. So for example, if you spend ten hours in bed, but you're only asleep for six of those hours,\n",
      "then you might take six hours,\n",
      "add on thirty minutes because nobody is asleep from the moment they lie down in bed, So the moment they wake up in the morning.\n",
      "And then only let yourself have six and a half hours in bed and the way that you would practice, that would be by delaying your bedtime\n",
      "but waking up at the same time that you normally wake up in the morning.\n",
      "That will reduce the amount of time that you're spending awake in bed, and substantially improve your sleep quality in short order. Although, frankly, the first week or two will be very difficult because You might find that initially your sleep quality isn't that high and you are losing a bit of sleep. You might feel very fatigued during the day,\n",
      "But very soon, the improvements in sleep quality will more than compensate for the small reduction in sleep duration that sometimes occurs.\n",
      "Then in part two of my conversation with Simon, we spoke about problem versus emotion focused coping strategies.\n",
      "And how the people who most effectively\n",
      "cope with stress tend to use both of these types of strategies.\n",
      "Problem focused\n",
      "strategies\n",
      "address the underlying cause\n",
      "of stress.\n",
      "For some people, that might be financial stress due to spending too much money on non essential things.\n",
      "For others, the stress might be from a toxic relationship.\n",
      "A helpful example of a problem focused coping strategy\n",
      "is called scheduled\n",
      "worry time.\n",
      "The idea here is that we're trying to compartmentalize\n",
      "the time that we spend wiring each day by dedicating\n",
      "a specific period\n",
      "in which to worry.\n",
      "And sometimes you might dedicate a specific space\n",
      "in which to worry you could have a worry chair in your office or in your home where you practice\n",
      "your worry time.\n",
      "And during this worry time, sit down with a piece of paper and a pen. You can also use a laptop or your phone for this,\n",
