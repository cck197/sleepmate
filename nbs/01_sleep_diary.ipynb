      "She begins tracking her sleep. She learns that, on average, she’s in bed from 10 PM to 8 AM\n",
      "each night - a 10-hour sleep opportunity. But she’s only asleep for 6 of those hours in total, so\n",
      "her sleep efficiency is 60 % (6 / 10 X 100).\n",
      "Under supervision, Amy begins bedtime restriction therapy. This involves delaying her bedtime\n",
      "(which helps build extra pressure to sleep) such that she only spends 6 hours (her average\n",
      "sleep duration) in total in bed each night. So, her new sleep opportunity is from 2 AM to 8 AM,\n",
      "and she meticulously goes to bed and gets up at precisely the same times throughout this\n",
      "intervention.\n",
      "At first, this is rough. She’s even more tired than normal. But very quickly her sleep efficiency\n",
      "improves dramatically. When her average sleep efficiency is above 85 % (which is generally\n",
      "considered healthy) for a week, she advances her bedtime by 15 minutes. Her sleep opportunity\n",
      "is now 6 hours and 15 minutes. This process then repeats itself - if her sleep efficiency at the\n",

      "Once she is spending as much time asleep as she needs, she retains her new bedtimes. Three\n",
      "months later, she settles on going to bed at 11:30 PM, waking up at 8 AM, and her sleep is 88 %\n",
      "efficient. She feels like a new person.\n",
      "So, what can we all learn from this?\n",
      "● If you’re struggling to sleep through the night, enforcing regular bedtimes is critical. If\n",
      "your sleep is poor, don’t start going to bed earlier and earlier. Set an alarm for 1 hour\n",
      "before bedtime to ingrain your bedtimes.\n",

      "advocating alarm clock use if your sleep is healthy though!\n",
      "How to sleep through the night: a summary of key\n",
      "concepts\n",
      "That’s all for now. If you’re struggling to sleep through the night, in addition to applying basic\n",
      "principles of good sleep hygiene during the daytime, minimise napping, use the 20-minute rule,\n",
      "and be meticulous about bedtime regularity! Do these things and you’ll reap the rewards of\n",
      "more restorative sleep. Two ways of tracking sleep are:\n",
      "1) Using devices: There’s now a panoply of sleep-tracking devices out there, the most\n",
      "common of which are finger- or wrist-worn. While I can’t claim this confidently when\n",
      "manufacturers are continually updating their devices, there simply doesn’t seem to be a\n",
      "big difference in the accuracy of most of these devices. So, if you buy a wearable, pick\n",
      "one made by a reputable manufacturer that has the functionality you’re after. At the time\n",
      "of writing, I wouldn’t pay attention to things like sleep stages or sleep “scores” - just\n",
      "focus on the sleep timing and duration data.\n",
      "2) Using a diary: If I had to pick either a wearable or a sleep diary, I’d probably pick a\n",
      "sleep diary. In addition to quantitative measures, how well you feel you slept is important,\n",
      "and an advantage of sleep diaries is that you can record various factors that might affect\n",
      "your sleep. You’d probably prefer to keep a digital diary, so you could try one such as\n",
      "this.\n",
      "To establish your baseline sleep, track it every morning for two weeks. To ingrain this tracking\n",
      "habit, pair it with a routine activity, such as waiting for the kettle to boil. As your habits largely\n",
      "determine whether your health improves or deteriorates, you will surely benefit from learning\n",
      "more about how to shape your habits for the better. For more on this, check out the SEEDS\n",
      "journal.\n",
      "Having trouble sleeping? Your bed is the most\n",
      "important item of furniture you own\n",
      "Consider this:\n",
      "You will spend about a third of your life asleep...\n",
      "… so you should make sure you’re sleeping on a good mattress!\n",
      "While you’re tracking your baseline sleep, you might want to buy a new mattress. Three key\n",
      "variables to consider when buying a mattress are comfort, durability, and support.\n",
      "In recent years, “bed in a box” mattresses have dramatically increased in popularity. To be\n",
      "foldable, these are made of foam. The problem with this is that foam tends to absorb heat, and\n",
      "you won’t sleep well if you get too hot. Some manufacturers use cooling gels to attempt to\n",
      "overcome this limitation, but it’s unclear how long the gels last. As spring mattresses dissipate\n",
      "heat more efficiently, they’re probably better than foam mattresses for most people. Another key consideration is mattress firmness. Heavier people tend to benefit from firmer\n",
      "mattresses. If you sleep with a bed partner, the two of you may prefer different mattress\n",
      "firmnesses. Fortunately, some mattresses are made to have different firmnesses on either side.\n",
      "Next, when it comes to mattresses, you generally get what you pay for. So, if you can afford a\n",
      "good mattress, buying a mattress is not the time to be thrifty. You should pick a mattress that\n",
      "you have tried before buying, and if you buy one from a shop then lie down on potential options\n",
      "for at least 10 minutes each.\n",
      "If you have lots of disposable income, you could try a water-cooled mattress pad to help you\n",
      "more closely control your bed temperature. Perhaps the best-known of these are the ChiliPAD\n",
      "and OOLER. Cooler still (forgive me), we’re now at the cusp of the emergence of “smart” beds\n",
      "such as this one, which apparently uses AI to optimise in-bed conditions. I anticipate that smart\n",
      "beds may be very useful for those who can afford them, we just don’t know much about how\n",
      "well this technology works yet.\n",
      "Finally, as per your mattress, ensure that your pillows, blankets and sheets are breathable and\n",
      "effectively dissipate heat too. This may seem odd to some, but one strategy I have always found\n",
      "useful is keeping a duvet cover without any duvet in it handy. That way you can use the cover\n",
      "alone if you get too hot at night. Or you can use the duvet and the separate cover concurrently -\n",
      "for example, you might cover your lower body with your duvet but your torso with a duvet cover\n",
      "alone.\n",
