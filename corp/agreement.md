# Startup Agreement between Christopher Kelly and Greg Potter

**Effective Date:** 19 Oct 2023

## Parties Involved:
- Christopher Kelly ("Chris")
- Greg Potter ("Greg")

## Business Description:
The startup aims to develop and commercialize a service designed to help individuals overcome insomnia through the use of an AI coach. The service will be marketed as offering expertise similar to that of Greg but in a form that is always accessible and at a lower cost. It will be explicitly stated that the service is not Greg, and the service will never use the word "I" to describe itself.

### Responsibilities:

1. **Christopher Kelly ("Chris"):**
   - Conduct all coding and technical work required to deploy and administrate the service.
  
2. **Greg Potter ("Greg"):**
   - Provide technical oversight for the project. Greg decides when the service is ready for initial customer testing, with a goal of obtaining customer feedback as soon as possible, ideally in a timeframe of weeks and not months.
   - Chris understands that Greg cannot make any specific time commitment at this time. Greg's input will come via continued occasional voice memos.

Both Chris and Greg commit to promoting the service on their respective podcasts. Chris will use his email list for promotion.

### Business Structure:

- Prior to receiving any customer payments, the parties will establish a Delaware C Corporation ("C Corp").
- A business bank account will be opened at the time of incorporation.
- Ownership of the C Corp will be represented by shares.
- Chris and Greg will be allocated an equal number of shares in the C Corp.

### Asset Management:

- All materials, including source code and data, will be stored in a GitHub repository.
- Both Chris and Greg will have full access to this repository.

### Additional Founder:

- If both parties agree, one additional co-founder may be added to the startup.

### Financial Responsibilities:

- Chris will cover all hosting costs for the service until the first customer payment is received.
- In the event that the C Corp needs to be shut down, Chris will cover the associated costs.

### Investment:

- Both parties are open to outside investment, although it is not required for development to proceed.

### Revenue Sharing:

- Revenues will be distributed in accordance with the ownership share as represented by the shares held by each party in the C Corp.

### Amendments:
